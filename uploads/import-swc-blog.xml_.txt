		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my last blog, I discussed why it’s important to establish a ‘Governance Plan’ for your <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> implementation.  Without some controls and guidelines for proper usage, it can quickly degenerate into a disorganized, difficult-to-use, non-solution.

So, how do you approach developing a Governance Plan for your Microsoft SharePoint environment?  It’s helpful to start by breaking it down into several separate, but related ‘Governance Areas’:
<ul>
	<li>Information Governance</li>
	<li>Applications Governance</li>
	<li>Operations Governance</li>
</ul>
When developing a <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint Governance plan</a> method and sequence is important.  There is a logical order to the list of Governance Areas, with each building upon the decisions made and guidelines developed in the previous area.

Information Governance primarily covers information architecture and security, which defines the navigation and site structure of your SharePoint environment, along with access controls and accountability.  This is the foundation upon which SharePoint success is built- ensuring that information is well-organized, well-managed and easy to find is of upmost importance.

Applications Governance deals with things like visual design, customization and automation.  SharePoint’s out-of-the-box usability is good, but some well thought-out enhancements to its aesthetics and user experience can really inspire people to embrace and adopt it more fully.  Actively managing those customizations and their deployment ensures a stable and predictable environment for end users.

Operations Governance includes all of the other things that have to happen ‘behind the scenes’ to ensure the availability and integrity of the SharePoint environment. Disaster recovery, monitoring, database maintenance and many other aspects of the deployment should be defined and documented, based on the ‘best practices’ and the particular needs of your organization.

As part of a comprehensive ‘Governance Plan’, each of the above ‘Governance Areas’ is important to consider carefully.  There are a variety of key decisions to be made in each area, and it’s critical to make well-informed choices and document the resulting guidelines and processes in a way that can be leveraged by all users of the solution.  When everyone clearly understands what they should (and shouldn’t) do in SharePoint, success is much easier to achieve and real business value follows.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Also known as “SEO”

Either way the name doesn’t do the thing justice. With the launch of our own <a title="SWC SEO" href="/solutions/digital-design">SWC SEO</a> practice I have gotten to know the power of this capability and its reach is way more than people think.

Generally speaking when <a title="SWC Search Engine Optimization" href="/solutions/digital-design">Search Engine Optimization</a> comes up most folks think the conversation is going to focus on how to get to the top of Google’s results page. Most people intuitively understand the importance of being on the top of a search list but the numbers are staggering. For me, there are two data points that I think say it all:
<ul>
	<li>Page one search result listings receive 95% of searchers clicks.  In other words, if you’re not on page one the best you can hope for is to win the battle for the remaining 5% of search clicks.</li>
	<li>The #1 search ranking receives 36% of the page clicks...In the world of SEO being the best is indisputable and disproportionately valuable.</li>
</ul>
So, yes, an important part of SEO is getting to the top of the Google (or Bing) search result list - but what may be more important than the result of SEO is the process in which SEO derives its results.

A great deal of SEO data comes from various applications that monitor, document and analyze web site activity, structure, and content.  This information is then juxtaposed against other sets of data that reflect the top performers in Google and Bing as well as (what most folks are interested in) how the competition is performing.  So basically, it’s the kind of information that tells you how your site is performing in the world of the Internet against the market and the competition. Things like:
<ul>
	<li>What key words the search engines are looking for when they scan your site</li>
	<li>What key words the search engines think you should be focused on</li>
	<li>What key words your competition is focused on and how you rank against those competitors – for each keyword</li>
</ul>
But that’s not all...(sorry, couldn’t help it).  In a typical SEO engagement we are also able to really decompose a web site’s performance and analyze trends and patterns related to site traffic and activity. With some careful consideration we can begin to deduce:
<ul>
	<li>Why viewers are coming to your website and how they got there in the first place.</li>
	<li>What parts of each web page are visually compelling and draw the most clicks.</li>
	<li>What messaging is working the best</li>
</ul>
In the end, all of this information provides us with a very clear sense for how to affect market strategy – not just for the company web site but for the company itself.

		<title>Microsoft Unified Communications…A Game Changer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are a whole bunch of reasons why I like working in the technology industry. It's fast moving and fun but what I like most of all is the profound impact that IT can have on business. Pretty routinely these days a technology comes around that radically effects how we operate - whether it's changing the cost of doing business, opening up new markets or just allowing us to work in new and exciting ways – Microsoft's Unified Communications (UC) is one of these solutions.

At the heart of <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications</a> are <a title="Microsoft Exchange 2010" href="ht/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2010">Microsoft Exchange</a> 2010 and <a title="Microsoft Lync 2010" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2010">Microsoft Lync</a> 2010. Together these products offer email, calendaring, Unified Messaging, Instant Messaging, Presence, conferencing and VoIP. All from a platform and experience that is tightly integrated with the Microsoft Office 2010 stack, is highly intuitive and user friendly.

In 2012 the real story of Unified Communications is the proven ability of Microsoft Lync to become a stand-alone telephony system. To offer the option of eliminating that old, clunky, proprietary PBX system back in the corner of your datacenter.

In making this trade our clients are finding great financial returns. In some cases it's as simple as not needing to invest in a new PBX environment. In other cases, it's the ability to reduce charges associated with call times. For almost everyone there are significant savings in moving to a Lync-hosted conference call service. Typically speaking the Microsoft Unified Communications platform will pay for itself within its first year of operations.

ROI aside, Microsoft Unified Communications is a game changer in how we communicate. Providing users with the ability to identify, communicate and collaborate with the right people at the right time – every time.

The technology that surrounds communications is more powerful than ever. At SWC, a full-service <a title="IT Company" href="http://www.swc.com">IT company</a>, we are working with our clients every day to make sure they are finding success with this new and exciting solution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s been a little over a year now since we launched our <a title="Digital Design" href="/solutions/digital-design">digital design</a> practice.  During that time we have produced more than a dozen sites, many of them on the <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a> platform. Today we proudly showcase these projects on our digital portfolio.  But it’s where that portfolio resides that – I think – truly represents our greatest first team milestone; and that is our company website: www.swc.com

Recently we re-launched www.swc.com. We have always been proud of our brand and, in particular, our website.  For years it has (we believe) represented our firm through a polished aesthetic and crisp communication style.  But like anything else, there was room for improvement.  Our new site reflects a number of enhancements that are worth noting.  It is also a great example of our ability to deliver superior websites through our digital design practice.

Professional designers are not just classically trained but are also passionate about design.  They understand what works and what doesn’t and appreciate the idea that strong design serves a functional purpose.  The new www.swc.com leverages a “TILE” structure which is designed to provide efficient communication while maintaining a compelling aesthetic.  This approach is gaining strong momentum in digital design trends and is notably featured in the upcoming release of <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Windows 8</a>.

As a consulting firm we are very focused on recruiting talented individuals that are team oriented and have a high level of integrity. This focus was recently recognized by Crain’s Chicago Business with SWC being ranked as one of the best places to work in the city. To underscore this commitment we paid particular attention to our <a title="IT Consulting Company Careers" href="/careers">SWC Careers</a> page, investing in the production of “must see” employee videos.

Search Engine Optimization has become a critical component of marketing.  Our digital design practice has begun to staff <a title="Search Engine Optimization Consultants" href="/solutions/digital-design/search-engine-optimization">SEO consultants</a> and is now delivering this capability along with our site design offerings.  As we recreated swc.com we paid particular attention to SEO – not just in how we structured the site or the content we placed within it but in our platform and the processes that we will leverage in the days, weeks and months to come.

Indeed there has been great change to www.swc.com but in so many ways this change has been good.  I am more proud today of our website then I have ever been. Of course, there is more to come.  We have many planned enhancements which should be stunning and I will (like a proud parent) keep you posted on these developments.  In the interim, I am hopeful to collect your reaction to what we have just published.  Please take a look at the site and let me know your thoughts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Contrary to popular belief, <a title="Chicago Business Intelligence" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence</a> doesn't have to be horribly complicated, prohibitively expensive, or torturously long in getting accomplished.

At <a title="Chicago IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">Chicago IT consulting firm</a>, SWC, we focus on the middle market working with organizations that have hundreds or thousands of employees. Our clients tend to be very pragmatic in the way they do business. So, over the years we have learned how to create and deploy meaningful business intelligence assets that can be in production quickly and can drive meaningful ROI.

There are two key components in our approach to Business Intelligence – technology and methodology.

At SWC our core BI technology is <a title="Microsoft SQL Server" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server</a>. Its most recent edition – <a title="SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL Server 2012</a>, just released offers several significant enhancements that extend the power of Business Intelligence in ways that we would have never imagined only a handful of years ago. Features such as Power View and Power Pivot allow end-users to quickly create rich, interactive analysis at a variety of levels – using intuitive and user friendly authoring tools. And because this is all part of the Microsoft stack experience, these very insightful views can be quickly shared throughout an organization using the collaboration capabilities of Microsoft SharePoint, Lync, Exchange and Office.

Beyond the technology is how SWC seeks to design and deploy Business Intelligence solutions. Over recent years we have adopted an "agile" development methodology. The idea with agile is to define and develop a discreet, pragmatic solution which is released incrementally for both production use and immediate feedback from users. From there we continue to build out the capabilities of the environment in this type of building block mode – iterating and constantly enhancing the features and capabilities of the business intelligence solution. Through this approach BI projects are affordable and impactful – two words that fundamentally define IT in the middle market.

Through the power of business intelligence we give our clients the ability to identify and understand the challenges and opportunities they face every day. We help them succeed and we help them succeed faster.

		<title>Why SWC is Developing a SalesForce.com Practice</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We’ve been delivering <a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM" href="/solutions/crm">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a> solutions since the earliest viable versions. We’ve developed one of the best Microsoft CRM solution delivery teams in the Chicago area. We have countless satisfied Microsoft CRM users. The Microsoft CRM 2011 release was one of the better new releases from Microsoft in a number of years. We continue to value the strengths of Microsoft CRM, including its unparalleled Outlook and <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a> integration capabilities and its economic value.

So why is SWC starting a <a title="Salesforce.com CRM" href="/solutions/crm">SalesForce.com</a> practice?
Several reasons:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Our customers asked us to.</strong> Many had chosen SalesForce.com before they met us. They liked the product, but had trouble finding a high quality provider to support their efforts. The mid-market is especially under-served when it comes to this technology.</li>
	<li><strong>We found that we were good at it.</strong> Implementing CRM solutions is as much about functional and process design as it is about technology. Those skills translate quite nicely from Microsoft to SaleForce.com. And our deep Java development experience helped us to master APEX.</li>
	<li><strong>We like the product.</strong> Many customers will be best served by the Microsoft’s value proposition. Many others will place a greater emphasis on the collaboration and social features that have come to differentiate SalesForce.com. Some will fall in the middle, served well by either solution. And we’ll help our customers navigate that choice.</li>
</ol>
So keep your eyes peeled over the next few months as we roll out events that will showcase both of these technologies in their best light. Most importantly, we’ll help you decide what’s right for you.

		<title>Digital Design: An Integral Part of the Technology Experience</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In so many ways design has become an integral part of technology. Today as individuals we are surrounded by computers, tablets, smart phones and now with the Cloud we have the ability to have extremely interactive, meaningful experiences anywhere and at any time. This is the Consumerization of IT - and it's fantastic. But with all of this has come a huge lift in user sophistication and generally speaking a tremendous expectation of the technology experience. We have become accustomed to consuming information - no matter where we are - whether at home or at work - in a way that is compelling and at the very least easy.

It's this concept that is at the heart of SWC Design. It's the idea that form - or design - is meant to enhance function. In practical terms this design philosophy is helping us provide our clients with tremendous advantages in the development of <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint environments</a>, eCommerce sites as well as mobile applications. We have always been a firm that has understood functionality and pragmatic efficiency – today we are enhancing that capability with very real, very sophisticated user experience and graphic design talent and expertise.

In developing our design practice we have also made investments in our ability to deliver around <a title="Search Engine Optimization" href="/solutions/digital-design/search-engine-optimization">search engine optimization</a> - or SEO. The idea behind SEO is to structure the architecture, code and content of a website in such a way that it finds preference with dominant search engines such as Google or Bing. We believe that if our clients are going to invest in creating compelling, aesthetically beautiful and functionally efficient websites they are going to want users to find them.

Mastering the art of marketing in the 21st Century requires an equal command of current technology and classical business acumen. Please join me for my <a title="Digital Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">Digital Design</a> and Search Engine Optimization event where I will explore and demonstrate how digital design, integrated marketing and search engine optimization (SEO) are driving growth and a competitive advantage for today’s market leaders.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first step toward accelerating BI access is to examine what you are working with – what kind of information do you have access to and what kind of structure currently exists to provide that information to those users. Our <a title="Business Intelligence Solution" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">business intelligence solutions</a> help users build out a cube structure (that’s more robust) to join everything together, rather than having users spend days or even weeks copying and pasting information from various sources into Excel or Access databases. With a robust cube, users can then quickly get into the details and do the analysis they are looking for through Excel, various dashboard technologies, etc. Putting a better structure and data model in place is a key place to start.

The process of creating a comprehensive business intelligence solution can be long and arduous. At SWC, we have been utilizing an <a title="Agile Business Intelligence" href="/blog/business-intelligence/agile-approach-business-intelligence">agile</a> approach that allows you to take a project and break things down into smaller iterations, while still focusing on the overall big picture and end goal. This provides end users with production level and workable solutions faster so that they can start to see their reports and data materialize, allowing them to provide more focused feedback for future iterations. This way, they don't have to wait six months for you to provide data that they realize they don't want. Working with them to break it down into bite-sized pieces helps promote a quicker turnaround time and also gets them results that they can start working with while you are building out the next iteration.

Along with the previous point, one of the challenges that exist in this process is that users are only used to looking at data from a specific viewpoint. They have a hard time articulating requirements – often, they know what they DON'T want, but aren't necessarily skilled in outlining what they do want. Breaking it down allows them to get a better handle on their wants and needs, provide something tangible from them to assess and sparks conversations about deeper and more complex requirements that can then be delivered more rapidly because everyone is working toward the same specific results.

In terms of tools, <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server 2012</a> is top notch in terms of self-service BI and analytics. It still helps to partner with IT in order to determine what kind of data is needed and put the models in place to secure that data and structure it appropriately, but once those requirements are determined, the users can go in and retrieve unaided. They can create new reports and have better access to the data, in essence allowing any user to create a highly visual, richly interactive, and presentation ready solution. Cutting out the middle man obviously saves time and speeds things up. Since this is part of the Microsoft stack, users can share this information quickly with others using the collaboration capabilities of <a title="Microsoft Sharepoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a>, <a title="Microsoft Lync" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2010">Lync</a>, <a title="Microsoft Exchange" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2010">Exchange</a> and Office.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Chicago NATO Summit will be held downtown this year from May 20th to 21st. Many customers are wondering how this might affect them or how they can prepare.

The recent NATO discussions I have had with my customers and colleagues revolve around Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Planning. Below are two articles I was published in related to these topics that I think are helpful.

Picking A Disaster Recovery Site (note: no longer a valid link)

<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/solution-series/2011/11/how-to-rank-your-apps-and-proc.php" target="_blank">How to Rank Your Apps and Processes According to the Fire Alarm Scale</a>

At SWC, we have already begun the process of getting our <a title="Chicago IT Service" href="http://www.swc.com">Chicago IT</a> customers ready by encouraging them to check remote system availability for their users and to review Business Continuity and <a title="Managed IT Solutions" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">IT Contingency plans</a> before the NATO Summit. Additionally, we have increased staffing at our Network Operations Center in Oak Brook, IL to provide remote support for them and their users.

		<title>The Evolution of Microsoft SharePoint</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been working with <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> since the inception of the product in 2001.  Over time this platform has seen tremendous enhancements in capability and is considered by Gartner to be one of the leading search, portal and content management solutions available in today's market.  As a reflection of its success SharePoint is used by 78% of Fortune 500 companies and between the years of 2006 and 2011 Microsoft sold over 36.5 million SharePoint user licenses.

The challenge with Microsoft SharePoint has always been focus.  Inherently the platform can do so much that it can become difficult for our clients to understand where and how they are going to get their best return from the technology.  Of course there are a number of ways to address this challenge but at SWC Technology Partners, we have found that there are some critical elements that once addressed have exponential benefits.  The first is to adopt a pragmatic, goal oriented approach to the solutions roadmap – and to apply the 80/20 rule.  How is our client going to get 80% of the solution's value with 20% of its functionality?  How are they going to establish a beachhead of capability and then incrementally build from there?

With the solution roadmap in place we have learned that understanding the value of the user experience or the aesthetic of the site is absolutely critical to the solution's ultimate adoption.  The reality is that as humans we have a tendency to embrace those things we find exciting and easy to use.  At SWC, our <a title="IT Consultants" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consultants</a> have honed the ability to create rich and beautiful SharePoint environments – providing them with an intuitive, easy and rewarding experience.  In the end, we know that if they value going to SharePoint once then they are likely to return and, of course, likely to tell their coworkers. Go ahead and check out some of our <a title="SharePoint Design Portfolio" href="/portfolio/index.html">SharePoint designs</a> from our digital design portfolio!

In business the power to share is a fundamental component to success and at SWC we are helping our Chicago area business clients become more productive through collaboration.

		<title>Microsoft Windows 8 and the Consumerization of IT</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, what does that mean?  "The consumerization of IT" – I like to think of it as the blurring of lines – the blurring of lines between our work and personal environments and the technologies that we use.  Today because of the Internet, the Cloud and mobile computing our expectations of technology have risen to new heights.  When we need information – we expect and most often demand – that we can efficiently find that information no matter what time it is and no matter where we are.  And the idea of accessing technology any different at work then we do in our personal lives seems a little silly.

It's because of the consumerization of IT that the release of <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Microsoft's Windows 8</a> is so critical to today's middle-market IT organization.  Windows 8 will provide today's user with the rich, intuitive touchscreen and tablet interface that they have become used to - and of course, with Windows 8 that touchscreen experience will extend to the laptop and the desktop.  But what Windows 8 will truly represent is the ability for today's IT manager to deploy this type of experience in a highly secure and managed infrastructure.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4278" title="Microsoft Windows 8 Touchscreen" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-windows-8-touchscreen-300x231.jpg" alt="Microsoft Windows 8 Touchscreen" width="300" height="231" />

Because Windows 8 is a Microsoft operating system running on Active Directory and is completely integrated within the other components of the Microsoft stack there is no compromise between user experience and user productivity or network management for that matter.  The collaborative powers of <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a>, Office and <a title="Microsoft Lync 2010" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2010">Lync</a> are seamlessly integrated with Windows 8.  The security, deployment and management tools of Systems Center are seamlessly extended into Windows 8 as they have been with its predecessors.

In many ways the success of IT is measured in how we empower those around us.  <a title="Microsoft Windows" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</a> 8 is a product that is going to help us meet this mission head on.

		<title>How to Break Business Intelligence Users’ Excel Addiction</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/business-intelligence/break-bi-users-excel-addiction</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, a reporter asked me to comment on how organizations can adjust their <a title="Business Intelligence" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence</a> (BI) efforts to users' persistent "addiction" to Microsoft Excel and if I had any ideas for weaning users away from Excel in favor of more modern solutions?

I think there are two issues here. First, there are the users that should be using Excel because they are looking to do that deep dive analysis that requires them to slice and dice through the information. With the level of interaction and manipulation they want to do with the data, Excel is likely the most appropriate tool for them. The problem is that in many cases they are using it ineffectively. Often, in order to have access to all of the data they need to do their analysis they find themselves copying and pasting in information from various sources. They may download pieces of data from Access databases, move over columns from other reports, link to data in other spreadsheets, cut and paste from email, or manually enter various items. Additionally, if they are writing their own queries to various tables of information, they may be running into issues with data retrieval, bandwidth, or invalid returns. By the time they are done just sourcing the data they need, there usually isn’t much time left to do the real analysis needed.

Organizations can help better support these users by providing them with a centralized structure for all of that information. We have worked with many customers to utilize tools like <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server</a> to provide a centralized environment for the data which can then be presented to them in a more meaningful format. They can add speed to the analysis and take away the complexity as well by building out cubes for the key dimensions and measures the users need access to; providing them with accurate and accessible data which allows them to spend less time searching for answers. They can still use tools like Excel with Pivot Tables where they can now quickly select the fields they need for their analysis and start to drill into the data. This also allows for a centralized model for multiple groups, where each area or individual can still select a subset of that data for their own use.

There are other users, however, that have found themselves utilizing Excel due to the fact that they have no other solution to choose from. Or the data that is presented to them in reports or other solutions is more or less than what they need. These users then download the information they do have to Excel in order to massage, manipulate and augment that data rather than do analysis. Many of these users would be better served with dashboard or reporting solutions. The challenge here again is presenting these users with the data that they need and in a format they can consume. These users can benefit from the same strategy of a cube build that will then quickly provide them with the data they need in a dashboard, through a Pivot Table, or through more ad hoc or interactive reporting solutions such as PowerView. However, these can also be large, expensive and time consuming processes. We have had a lot of success with customers working with smaller iterations of projects such as these by doing initial pilots on a small area and by utilizing an Agile approach to building out an appropriate business intelligence solution. This provides faster deliverables that users can start to adopt right away, building excitement and momentum for continued use. It is also more cost effective and establishes a quicker ROI for senior management, providing further support for expansion to other areas.

One final thought is that in order for any of this to happen, the users need to have confidence in the data that is being presented to them. Many times when you start to move away from the manual processes they are accustomed to, there is a great deal of hesitation that the automation is pulling the right data. It is often appropriate to run both the old and new process in parallel for a period of time so that they can become comfortable with not only the new way of working but also that that information is accurate. This issue can be further mitigated with Data Quality solutions utilized to profile, validate and cleanse the data upfront. Having the users participate in creation of the validation rules for the data can also help alleviate this concern and there are some newer solutions, like SQL Server 2012’s Data Quality Services, that will provide views into the results of these activities for further validation of them.

		<title>Why I Am No Longer Skeptical About Windows 8</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a> SWC has just completed its inaugural <a title="Microsoft Windows" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</a> 8 Luncheon just outside of Chicago, and the feedback from the audience was what we expected. Some of them were skeptical whether Microsoft was too late to the mobile/touchscreen device market, while others were excited at the prospect of having a tablet device that can integrate into enterprise security and compliancy.  Mostly, everyone was curious how <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Windows 8</a> devices would fit in their environment with the success of <a title="Microsoft Windows 7" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-7">Windows 7</a>.  I admit that I went into Windows 8 with the same questions as everyone else.  So let’s address some of those <em>“assumptions”</em>:
<ul>
	<li><em>The Metro is gaudy and awkward looking.</em> The Metro interface is in fact fluid and easily customizable, even in the beta stages. I can’t wait to see some of the newer apps coming onboard.</li>
	<li><em>No start menu, no thanks.</em> The desktop is still there and no different than Windows 7.  The start menu is actually more easy to use because you can get to what you need without the desktop.</li>
	<li><em>What if I don’t want a touch screen?</em> Windows 8 is absolutely fully functional with a keyboard and mouse. In fact, I am typing this blog now from a keyboard and mouse.</li>
	<li><em>Microsoft Mobile or tablet is never going to catch on.</em> If consumerization will bring devices from life to work, I think it will have the same effect the other way around.  Let’s face it; Windows 8 will be the only mobile platform that can be a fully functional corporate device.</li>
	<li><em>This is a toy not an enterprise level OS.</em> If you like Windows 7, you will like Windows 8.  Same functionalities, more features.</li>
</ul>
Overall, the <a title="Microsoft Windows 8 Event" href="/events">Windows 8 Luncheon</a> was a fun event, where we gathered important feedback on what IT leaders are expecting. What we learned was that customers don’t want a platform to switch to just because it’s the next release of a Windows OS.  Customers want a platform that is easy to use and as aesthetically focused as Apple or Google, yet is not limited in terms of accessibility to critical workplace applications like <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> and <a title="Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm">CRM</a>.  Is Windows 8 going to meet everyone’s high expectations?  We will soon find out, but one thing is for sure…I am not longer a skeptic!

		<title>Will Windows 8 Take Over the Smartphone Market?</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-windows/will-windows-8-take-over-the-smartphone-market</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I was asked if <a title="Microsoft Windows" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</a> will make major gains in the smartphone market share within the next few years or if there were any variables that could shift trends in a different direction?

Well, I do believe that <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Windows 8</a> is going to make major gains in the smartphone market share.  Microsoft has completely shifted its OS philosophy to be more user centric with fluid tiles on the metro interface, easy to use apps, and personalization across multiple devices. This is the model that made both Apple and Google market leaders. However, Microsoft’s biggest differentiator is its ability to integrate Windows 8 Mobile into the workplace, and this is huge!  Previously, access to corporate wide applications, such as <a title="Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm">CRM</a> and <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a> have been limited by a lack of integration with the enterprise.  Furthermore, security, compliancy, and management concerns have limited integration of Apple and Google mobile devices, which has always been one of the major reason Blackberry still has a decent market share on the corporate side.  Lately, we have heard a lot about consumerization and how more and more devices blur the line of personal life and work.  Consumers want to use their devices in the workplace, but what we often forget is that consumerization can also work the other way around.  As more corporations adopt Windows 8 Mobile, due to its manageability and security, we will see a trend of consumers bringing “workplace” devices into their “personal” realm.

This does not mean that Apple and Google smartphones are going away anytime soon, but with the mobile market expected to double by 2014, this does mean that Microsoft Windows 8 has the potential with its user centric approach and enterprise integration to make major market gains.

		<title>The Three Main Components of a CRM System</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Effectively managing the customer lifecycle – from marketing to sales to service – is critical to your company’s profitability and growth. That’s why many mid-market organizations have found value in choosing a <a title="Customer Relationship Management System" href="/solutions/crm">Customer Relationship Management</a> (CRM) system for their businesses. But, what many people don’t know is that a <a title="CRM System" href="/solutions/crm">CRM system</a> can be so much more than your basic <a title="Sales Force Automation" href="/solutions/crm">sales force automation</a> tool that captures account and contact data. So I wanted to tell you a little more about how a CRM system can really impact your business by exploring the three main components of today's solutions.
<h2>Drive Marketing Effectiveness and Maximize Marketing Spend</h2>
With a CRM solution, you can improve marketing effectiveness by providing marketing professionals with flexible segmentation tools, simplified campaign management capabilities, intuitive response tracking, and insightful analytics. This can lead to an increased pipeline full of qualified leads that can then be prioritized and routed to the right sales representatives. Having a single system for managing and tracking multi-channel marketing campaigns from lead to close allows you to easily create dashboards and reports to see which of your marketing efforts result in the most sales. A CRM solution gives you the power to demonstrate marketing’s impact on your organization’s bottom line and lets you begin reinvesting in the tactics and strategies that work best for your business.
<h2>Help Salespeople Win More Deals</h2>
All CRM systems provide the ability to build a complete customer history, resulting in increased sales productivity. This enables sales representatives to focus on turning opportunities into closed business with a single place for updating deal information, recording customer interactions, tracking competitors, and creating quotes. Your CRM system should enable your team to not only find the information and history they need, but also allow them to perform forecasting and customer planning activities, such as contract renewals and selling upgrades, etc. By reinforcing your sales process in CRM, sales representatives will gain a proven methodology for managing and closing deals.

Furthermore, a CRM system will allow representatives and managers to gain visibility across deals and prioritize their selling time, giving them the ability to close the right deals faster and increase their deal size. The system also eliminates painful administration tasks by automating work flows and approvals. Finally, a CRM system will give your sales manager the ability to create ownership and accountability, as well as oversight by tracking all sales representative activity.
<h2>Create Lifetime Customers with Attentive Service</h2>
Your CRM system does not stop when a deal is closed. Continue building your 360-degree customer view with your CRM's service module for your customer service and technical support teams. Empower your people with tools that simplify case management, streamline escalations, improve knowledge sharing, and enable more effective account management. The result of these tools and processes will help your organization contain service costs without sacrificing service quality. In fact, your customers will be delighted with service representatives who are armed with all of their customer history and the knowledge base necessary to efficiently and effectively resolve their issues.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m coming off a week in Toronto where I attended the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference. It’s me and 16,000 of Microsoft’s best friends. In fact, it’s the largest turnout for this event ever. It is undeniably an epic scene.

Some may be surprised to learn of a turnout like this for a Microsoft gathering. For years Microsoft has taken a backseat to companies like Apple, Google, Facebook in the press and most certainly in the public markets. In some cases for good reason; the competition was delivering a better product. And the company has had its missteps as most recently demonstrated with the <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/04/microsoft-s-6-2-billion-writedown-shows-it-s-losing-war-with-google.html" target="_blank">6.3 Billion dollar write off of aQuantive</a> and the pending, <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2012/07/microsoft-downfall-emails-steve-ballmer" target="_blank">scathing Vanity Fair article announcing Microsoft’s “Lost Decade”</a>.

But over the years Microsoft has placed a lot of bets and has won its share of big money battles, often in places that the public doesn’t clearly see. For SWC these victories are right in our sweet spot. Everyday our mid-market clients leverage <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server</a>, <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a>, <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications</a>, <a title="Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm">CRM</a> and Office to run efficient and innovative organizations. In many ways Microsoft “owns” the technology stack that runs business in the 21st Century. They dominate the back-office in much the same way they used to dominate the PC space.

What has plagued Microsoft over the last 10 years has been the consumerization of IT - the touch screen user experience and the online store, the Cloud and the ability for a browser and any device to provide the productivity value that was once reserved to the PC. Microsoft has known for years that in order to regain the dominance it once had it would need to dramatically address this issue. It would need to own the consumer experience as much as it has continued to own the back-office.

This was the sub-text to the week’s events here in Toronto. In some subtle and other not-so-subtle ways Steve Ballmer and his lieutenants announced that the time had come for Microsoft to attack. The message is this:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Microsoft Windows 8</a> (<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2406841,00.asp" target="_blank">released to manufacturing in August and available to the market in October</a>) will provide the touch-screen user experience that will finally give Apple something to worry about.</li>
	<li><a href="http://lubbockonline.com/technology/2012-06-24/review-microsoft-surface-straddles-divide" target="_blank">The Surface Tablet running Windows 8 will be manufactured by Microsoft so that they can control the entire experience</a>. Gone should be the configuration mishaps and clunky form factors that result from a channel handoff to organizations like HP, Dell and Samsung. It’s a very dramatic move that will alienate some very big, powerful partners, but in the end, Microsoft had no choice. This decision speaks volumes in terms of Ballmer’s commitment towards this strategy.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/xbox-took-40-per-cent-of-us-gaming-pot-in-2011-1054558" target="_blank">XBOX is a dominate gaming and entertainment appliance in today’s household</a>. We know it for Halo and Call of Duty and other interactive experiences but don’t forget it’s also a media unit for video and audio as well as a communications hub for instant messaging and VOIP. With Skype it’s also a video chatting portal.</li>
	<li>During this conference, <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-09/business/sns-rt-us-perceptivepixel-microsoftbre8680q8-20120709_1_windows-rt-yammer-worldwide-partner-conference" target="_blank">Microsoft announced the acquisition of Performance Pixel</a>. It’s this company that has perfected the technology that allows for the touch screen experience on large screens (when I say large, I mean 80 inch screens). Imagine the XBOX or Windows 8 experience on something like this…</li>
	<li>The Windows Stores will be everywhere come the holiday shopping season. There are nearly two dozen today but <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoftpri0/2018654251_wpc_day_3_live_blog.html" target="_blank">Microsoft plans on producing a number of “pop-up” stores to fill the gaps come the fall</a>. Imagine crowds at Microsoft stores like we see today at Apple. If Microsoft’s plans come true it may happen.</li>
</ul>
The announcements aren’t over. We are told to stay tuned over the coming days as more of Ballmer’s plans unfold.

I have to admit, as a business person it’s intriguing to watch this play out. I have no doubt that Microsoft and Ballmer are going to achieve their goals and recapture dominance in the technology sector. It’s a matter of time and frankly a reality of cash (60 Billion of cash). What remains to be figured out is when will the money pay off? When will the investments create the promised value and when will the consumer and the public market reward Microsoft for its strategy?

As of July 12th at 2:05 Microsoft is trading at 28.77 per share. Any takers for Microsoft at 40 per share by January 1, 2013?

		<title>How will Microsoft SharePoint Bring Value to My Business?</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-bring-value-to-business</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The two most commonly asked questions about <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> are, <em>"What is Microsoft SharePoint?"</em> and <em>"Why should I implement Microsoft SharePoint for my organization?"</em> Both are variations of the underlying question – <em>What value will it bring to my business?</em>

Basically, Microsoft SharePoint is a platform for quickly <a title="Chicago website design" href="/solutions/digital-design">building web sites</a> and web-based applications. As such, it can do and be a lot of different things. While that has, no doubt, contributed to SharePoint's success as a product, it makes it hard to understand what it's all about and how to get the most value out of it. So I have tried to break it down a little bit further for you in this blog.
<h2>Build Effective Communities</h2>
This covers perhaps the most fundamental usage of SharePoint – the <a title="SharePoint Intranet" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">corporate intranet</a> or organizational portal. These types of solutions allow organizations to disseminate information to employees in a richer, more interactive fashion than email or newsletters allow. Common examples include:
<ul>
	<li>News and Announcements</li>
	<li>Upcoming Events</li>
	<li>Shared Calendars</li>
	<li>Dashboards</li>
	<li>Links to Commonly Used Websites and Applications</li>
</ul>
The main benefits here are faster and easier access to information, tools and people, which can result in enhanced productivity.
<h2>Document and Content Management</h2>
Here, we are talking about two main areas. The first is managing the document lifecycle, from ‘cradle to grave.’ This includes file creation and receipt, collaboration, review, approval, and publishing, as well as addressing auditing and compliance requirements. The second area is content navigation and retrieval. Traditional folder structures are limiting – they provide a 'one dimensional' way of organizing files, which rarely works for everyone, all the time. SharePoint provides multiple ways of classifying files, which enables different methods of browsing and finding content, along with powerful search capabilities. These features can help people more quickly find the content they need, when and where they need it.

SharePoint also allows you to extend these concepts to parties external to the organization, in what's typically referred to as an ‘Extranet' scenario. You can enable secure outside access to a SharePoint environment, and allow customers, vendors and/or partners to view documents and information, or even communicate and collaborate interactively with your employees. This allows you to provide more value to your customers, and engage them more deeply. Unlike intranets and document management, which serve primarily to enhance productivity and reduce costs, extranets can actually drive top-line revenue in many cases.
<h2>Drive Organizational Efficiencies</h2>
Beyond the main areas we have already discussed, there are a variety of ways that SharePoint can help drive organizational efficiencies. It can serve as the platform for delivering all kinds of <a title="Business Intelligence" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a> and data visualization assets. It can help streamline repetitive business processes and make them more transparent and manageable. Last but not least, it can provide effective, integrated solutions for a wide variety of typical business challenges. Common examples include:
<ul>
	<li>Benefits Management</li>
	<li>Employee / Customer / Vendor Provisioning Processes</li>
	<li>Service Request / Requisition / Ticketing Systems</li>
	<li>Any Review or Approval Routing Scenario</li>
</ul>
Hopefully, the 'value areas' described above have helped shed some light on the many ways that SharePoint can benefit your organization. Of course, the examples provided barely scratch the surface of what is possible. I encourage you to contact the <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Consultants" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint consultants</a> at SWC if you are interested in discovering what Microsoft SharePoint has to offer, and how to successfully implement it for your business.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Customers drive your business success and the right <a title="Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm">Customer Relationship Management</a> (CRM) system can affect how your organization attracts new customers, manages opportunities and maintains high customer service levels. The first step to effectively managing this customer lifecycle is to choose your <a title="Customer Relationship Management Solution" href="/solutions/crm">CRM solution</a> wisely. In this two-part blog entry, we will take a look at some of the common features you should expect from all CRM solutions and then review the key strengths of Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Salesforce.com.

<a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM" href="/solutions/crm">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a> and Salesforce.com represent the premier CRM solutions available to the midmarket – and if you don’t believe me, check out these charts* from two top industry analysts, Forrester and Gartner. Both analysts rate them as solution leaders in the CRM space.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5031" title="The Forrester Wave CRM Suites Q2 2010" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/forrester-wave-crm-suites-q2-2010-300x298.png" alt="The Forrester Wave CRM Suites Q2 2010" width="300" height="298" />

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5032" title="Gartner Magic Quadrant Sales Force Automation Q2 2011" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/gartner-magic-quadrant-sales-force-automation-q2-2011-293x300.png" alt="Gartner Magic Quadrant Sales Force Automation Q2 2011" width="293" height="300" />*Chart 1: The Forrester Wave™ CRM Suites for Midsized Organizations (Q2 2010)
Chart 2: Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Sales Force Automation (Q2 2011)

While I feel that most CRM solutions offer the same basic core capabilities for managing marketing, sales and service, not every business is the same and each CRM solution offers unique strengths to meet your needs. For starters, let’s take a look at those core capabilities available in both solutions:

<strong>Accounts and Contacts:</strong> This is where it all started for CRM systems and allows for the capture, view and management of a complete, 360-degree view of your customers

<strong>Activity Capture:</strong> Your customer history is not complete without easily capturing each customer’s interaction from call logs to emails to meeting notes and documents

<strong>Marketing and Leads:</strong> Your sales pipeline starts here by managing all your marketing activities in one place; including managing lists and campaigns, tracking touches and prospect activity, and routing qualified leads to sales

<strong>Opportunities:</strong> Manage and close opportunities in a single place by standardizing and executing your proven sales methodology and recording customer interactions

<strong>Customer Service - Ticket/Case Management:</strong> Empower your people with tools that simplify case management, streamline escalations, improve knowledge sharing, and enable more effective account management

<strong>Workflow and Approvals:</strong> Automate approvals, eliminate redundant tasks, and experience widespread adherence to your business processes

<strong>Email and Calendaring:</strong> Integration with tools like Outlook and Gmail are now table stakes in the CRM space allowing for less administration and double entry

<strong>Dashboards and Reporting:</strong> Easily customize views for different roles

<strong>Mobility:</strong> View, capture, and manage activities from anywhere on your mobile devices

<strong>Configure to Your Sales Process:</strong> Map your sales teams' proven sales methodology to the technology

<strong>Collaboration:</strong> Purpose-driven collaboration with your peers to increase deal size and close opportunities faster

I know advocates of both vendors will tell you why their solution does these things better or has a better user experience or interface. But, if you're not sure which solution is best for you, let SWC provide you with a demonstration of both and help you decide for yourself. Just send us a <a href="mailto:info@swc.com?subject=CRM%20Demonstration%20Request" target="_blank">message</a>.

Stay tuned for my next blog, where I will dig into the key strengths that I believe differentiate these two CRM market leaders.

		<title>Choosing the Right CRM Solution Part II</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/customer-relationship-management/choosing-the-right-crm-solution-part-ii</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my last blog entry (<a title="Choosing CRM Solutions" href="/blog/customer-relationship-management/choosing-right-crm-solution">Choosing The Right CRM Solution Part I</a>), I wrote about the commonalities between <a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM" href="/solutions/crm">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a> and <a title="Salesforce.com CRM" href="/solutions/crm">Salesforce.com</a> (SFDC). In this blog I will review the capabilities that illustrate key strengths and differentiators between these two market leading CRM solutions. Let's take a look:

<strong>On-premise capability:</strong> This one is as clear as they come; Salesforce.com was born in the cloud and some believe they may have started the cloud revolution. Salesforce.com does not offer an on-premise option. Microsoft Dynamics CRM offers a robust on-premise solution and has recently invested heavily in their on-demand, cloud-based version of Dynamics CRM. If you require an on-premise solution, Microsoft is the only way to go. <strong>Winner: Microsoft Dynamics CRM</strong>

<strong>Mobile capabilities:</strong> Both solutions offer the ability to connect on mobile devices. <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/mobile/apps/" target="_blank">Salesforce's app</a> is free at all pricing levels and easy to install on any mobile device. However, to customize the app, a top tier <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/crm/editions-pricing.jsp" target="_blank">subscription</a> is required. Microsoft will be releasing enhanced mobile capability with Microsoft Dynamics <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2012/feb12/02-06CRMMobilePR.aspx" target="_blank">CRM Mobile in Q4</a> (delayed <a href="https://community.dynamics.com/product/crm/crmnontechnical/b/crmconnection/archive/2012/07/06/q2-2012-service-update-new-delivery-schedule.aspx" target="_blank">from Q2</a>), but it comes with a price tag of $30 per user per month. The Q4 service update will allow customers to access the complete functionality of Microsoft Dynamics CRM on virtually any device with a new cloud-based, cross-platform, native mobile client service. Because SFDC's app is free out of the box and readily available on all mobile devices, I'm giving it the advantage here. But…I do believe Microsoft will continue to invest in this critical functionality. <strong>Winner: Salesforce.com…but check back after Microsoft’s Q4 2012 release.</strong>

<strong>Integration and customization flexibility:</strong> Both Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Salesforce.com offer robust functionality out of the box. For complex environments requiring significant customization and integration with other back-office applications, Microsoft's on-premise solution offers the most flexibility. While both solutions offer an open architecture, as a cloud offering, we have found that SFDC has established some restrictions and limitations. There are some very large organizations using SFDC, so you know that they have found a way to make it work for them. This is not a deal breaker, but it may require some creativity on our team's part to meet your unique requirements. <strong>Winner: Microsoft Dynamics CRM</strong>

<strong>Rapid Innovation:</strong> Microsoft is Microsoft; they are capable of delivering a superior product when they make the investment and they have made that investment in recent years. Microsoft’s 2011 release was a significant upgrade and Dynamics CRM isn't their only software application. For Salesforce.com, this IS their space. They are a leader in this market space and are rapidly enhancing and expanding their footprint within the industry. As a pure cloud solution, SFDC is able to innovate and deploy updates and enhancements easier than Microsoft. <strong>Winner: Salesforce.com…with Microsoft quickly catching up!</strong>

<strong>Social Enterprise Capabilities:</strong> Similar to my point about innovation, Salesforce.com leads the way with their go-to-market strategy of building a “<a href="https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/" target="_blank">social enterprise</a>,” allowing you to connect customers and employees. They launched this revolution with the advent of Chatter and continue to expand with connections to other social tools like Facebook and LinkedIn. Microsoft countered <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/chatter/overview/" target="_blank">Chatter</a> with the <a href="http://crm.dynamics.com/en-us/nov2011" target="_blank">Activity Feed</a> functionality, but will need to further develop this area of their solution. While I believe the “social enterprise” has merit, we are a long way from our marketing, sales and service teams fully embracing this functionality, especially in the midmarket space. Thus, before you drink the “Kool-Aid” on SFDC's social capabilities; be sure this is truly a game-changer and deciding factor before over committing to this capability. <strong>Winner: Salesforce.com</strong>

<strong>Document Management:</strong> Document management capabilities in Microsoft Dynamics CRM are based on SharePoint. Users can take advantage of a wealth of document management capabilities including the ability to create custom content types, check-in/check-out capability, track changes, and version control. Salesforce.com used to market a solution they called Salesforce Content. However, it seems they have moved to suggesting customers <a href="http://blogs.salesforce.com/community/2012/04/chatter-files-a-better-option-for-attaching-files-to-records.html" target="_blank">publish documents via Chatter</a>. This suggests to me that they do not have a clearly defined strategy for document management or that it is not that important. I think it is critical – and did I mention that SWC has a phenomenal track record with Microsoft SharePoint deployments? <strong>Winner: Microsoft Dynamics CRM</strong>

<strong>Apps marketplace:</strong> If this topic is unfamiliar, think about Apples' App Store. Salesforce.com's <a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/home" target="_blank">AppExchange</a> has thousands of third party applications to extend a CRM deployment and is a leader in this space. Microsoft has a similar <a href="http://dynamics-crm.pinpoint.microsoft.com/en-US/home" target="_blank">Dynamics Marketplace</a>, but as a new offering, does not have nearly as many available apps. I expect Microsoft's offerings to continue to grow, but it will take some time before it can ever rival SFDC's AppExchange. <strong>Winner: Salesforce.com…but is this important to you?</strong>

<strong>Cost:</strong> Simply put, Salesforce.com is pricey. I remember being an early user/adopter of SFDC back in 2003. Back then, it didn't cost much – in fact, I think it was free. Having grown from a few thousand to 100,000 customers, they can now charge a premium for their solution. As a cloud solution, they charge a per user per month subscription fee at varying levels based on needed feature sets. <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/crm/editions-pricing.jsp" target="_blank">Salesforce’s subscription fees</a> range from $65 to $250 per user per month. Microsoft's cloud option, On Demand, is $44 per user per month. Pricing and licensing of Microsoft Dynamics CRM’s on premise solution is complex and can vary based on the existing Enterprise Agreement (EA) a company may have in place with Microsoft. You'll need to factor in server costs on top of your user licenses. <strong>Winner: Microsoft Dynamics CRM</strong>

<strong>User interface:</strong> Microsoft Dynamics CRM provides you with a CRM solution right within the familiar Microsoft Outlook application. If you know Microsoft Office applications, you can quickly adapt to the Dynamics CRM application. Salesfore.com's interface is similar to today's social media sites with a very friendly, web-based user interface. As previously noted, basic functionality of these tools is the same. For some, the user interface becomes a matter of personal preference. Would you and your users prefer and adopt a UI that looks and acts more like Outlook or Facebook? <strong>Winner: You decide!</strong>

Here’s a quick summary for those scoring at home:

<strong>Salesforce.com</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Rapid Innovation</li>
	<li>Mobile App</li>
	<li>Apps Marketplace</li>
	<li>Social Enterprise Capabilities</li>
	<li>User Interface (if you prefer a user interface more like Facebook than Microsoft Office)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Microsoft Dynamics CRM</strong>
<ul>
	<li>On-premise Option</li>
	<li>Value/Cost</li>
	<li>Document Management</li>
	<li>Integration Flexibility</li>
	<li>User Interface (if you like the Outlook user experience)</li>
</ul>
We have a lot more to talk about, so keep checking back for more blog entries about these two market leaders and SWC’s growing CRM practice!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my last blog I mentioned that SWC hosts monthly Chicago area events on <a title="Microsoft Windows" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</a> 8 and we have been asking our audience of midmarket <a title="IT Professionals" href="http://www.swc.com">IT professionals</a> what they think. Below is our latest video and my thoughts.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YyjJWploa4w?autoplay=1" title="Chicago IT Professionals Discuss Windows 8" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/win-8-videoplay.jpg" width="620" height="380" /></a>

I think this is great feedback from the Loyola Tech Guys! In my experience, probably one of the hardest audiences to please is techies, because they are early adopters of technology and have very high expectation for performance and fluidity. Techies also typically have the most applications to use, so hearing that the guys at Loyola have been using <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Windows 8</a> in production helps us backup Microsoft’s vision of blending consumerization and the enterprise. This really addresses the issues that consumers have using multiple devices like the iPad and Notebook. Windows 8 address these issues and gives business and consumer users the convenience of having one device for everything. Windows 8 meets the consumer’s needs for touch, ease of use, personalization, etc. AND the enterprise’s need for management and security.

Additionally, after talking to many midmarket IT professionals, I have learned that concerns are real in regards to how Windows 8 will fit in desktop environment. This goes along with our message that if you’re running Windows 7 on the desktop or planning a Windows 7 upgrade, there is no need to rush into thinking about Windows 8. Get Windows 7 deployed first and we will get you ready for Windows 8.

Subscribe to our blog and stay tuned, as SWC will continue to produce more Windows 8 videos at our events to share with you.

To learn more about how Microsoft Windows 8 can help you and your business, please join Chicago area IT consultants SWC Technology Partners for our next <a title="Microsoft Windows 8 Event" href="/events">Microsoft Windows 8 event</a> or follow <a title="Pete Lee LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pete-lee/4/b2b/989" target="_blank">Pete Lee on LinkedIn</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Join Chicago area <a title="IT Consultants" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consultants</a> SWC’s Rachael Narel at the TDWI Chicago Chapter’s August 10th Meeting on <a title="Business Intelligence Solution" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence Solutions</a>. Rachael will discuss why BI solutions get a bad rap for being complicated, expensive, and take way too long to implement. She will also go over the challenges many organizations face trying to achieve their end goals, including decentralized and complex data structures; users who are too busy to provide the necessary process input and have a hard time articulating requirements; and how to find a solution that provides the needed features within the allocated budget.

Most companies utilize a waterfall approach to Business Intelligence projects, but at this event, Rachael will share a better approach – <a title="Agile Business Intelligence" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">agile business intelligence</a> and the components needed for a successful and complete BI solution. An agile approach gives organizations a pragmatic solution released to users for production and immediate feedback. From there, organizations can continue to build out the capabilities in a building block mode, iterating and constantly enhancing the features and capabilities over time. The result is a more affordable and impactful Business Intelligence project, resulting in a faster ROI and increased user adoption and support.

Register <a href="http://bit.ly/Mj56nB" target="_blank">here</a> to attend this informative and free Business Intelligence event.

		<title>A Few Ways to Keep Employees Engaged and Have Fun in the Workplace</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/careers/ways-to-keep-employees-engaged</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is currently a huge demand for IT workers to fill hundreds of available tech jobs and <a title="Chicago Area IT Jobs" href="https://careers-swc.icims.com/jobs/search?ss=1&amp;searchLocation=&amp;searchCategory=&amp;hashed=0" target="_blank">IT positions</a>, especially in Chicago. Some may even argue that Chicago is becoming the new tech hub. At SWC, we too are currently hiring for many open IT positions. This is a direct result of our growth and the success we have seen as a company. More importantly, it is a reflection of our corporate culture and the great employees we have here who provide excellent service to our customers.

We are honored to have been externally recognized by many organizations this year for being one of the <a title="Best Places To Work In Chicago" href="/awards">best places to work in Chicago</a>. Beyond being a great place to work and having a great corporate culture, as an HR professional I am constantly thinking of new ways to keep our employees engaged and add value to our organization. One way we do this at SWC is through various informational, mentoring and social activities, which we feel are designed to create a sense of shared responsibility for the company’s success, bridge the gap between departments, and facilitate cross-functional collaboration. Here are a couple of ways we have fun at SWC and keep our employees engaged:

<strong>Mentoring Activities</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Some teams assigned IT Career Managers to each new hire to serve as an IT mentor and point of contact when it comes to different assignments and exposure to new technologies.</li>
	<li>Employees are also informally mentored by senior IT consultants, with whom they work side by side in implementing customer projects, enabling on-the-job learning.</li>
	<li>All employees receive a formal annual review to set future goals and assist with career advancement within the organization</li>
</ul>
<strong>Informational Activities</strong>
<ul>
	<li>We host regular ‘Lunch and Learn’ sessions sponsored by different departments enabling employees to learn about specific technology topics (Business Intelligence, IT Managed Services, SharePoint, Unified Communications, etc.).</li>
	<li>Employees are also invited to attend our Thursday informational lunches and <a title="Chicago Area  IT Events" href="/events">IT events</a> held at local restaurants for customers and prospects.</li>
	<li>Company financials, achievements and new initiatives are shared at the annual company meeting every year, along with management’s vision for the company’s future.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Social Activities Inside the Office</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Breakfast and Lunch – We bring in breakfast several times a month and lunch at least two times a week in conjunction with company meetings. We also always have healthy snacks and beverages available for our staff.</li>
	<li>Friday Happy Hour – This takes place at 4 pm in the SWC kitchen every Friday.</li>
	<li>Monthly Birthday Spread – Each month we celebrate all employee birthdays by bringing in a dessert assortment.</li>
	<li>Parties – We have random parties throughout the year. The last one was a huge Friday the 13th celebration related to receiving 13th Best Place to Work status from Crain’s Chicago Business. We gave away 13 big prizes (Xbox, Corn hole set, personal training sessions, iPad, iPod, vacation day, etc.) and had it fully catered.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Social Activities Outside the Office</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Annual Golf Outing – Golf and dinner.</li>
	<li>Annual Meeting /Team-Building – All annual meetings are held off-site at a fun setting followed by a team-building exercise. Recent sites/activities have included a TopGolf and a corn hole tournament, a race track outing, arcade games at Dave and Busters, and beach volleyball.</li>
	<li>Cubs Game Outing – This year we are renting the Budweiser Pavilion.</li>
	<li>Holiday Party – SWC sponsors an annual holiday party including SWC-paid hotel rooms for all employees.</li>
	<li>Summer Outing – These have included a private yacht cruise party on Lake Michigan.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Corporate Wellness Initiatives</strong>
Our employee wellness program is also unusually comprehensive. Highlights include:
<ul>
	<li>On-site fitness center</li>
	<li>Corporate-sponsored fitness activities, including participating in and training for the 3.5 mile Chase Corporate Challenge during ‘Test Your Time Tuesdays,’ and the SkyRise Chicago Race up the Willis Tower, intramural team sports and bike club.</li>
	<li>Fruit and veggie delivery service every Tuesday</li>
	<li>Healthy snack delivery (Greek yogurt, etc.) once a month</li>
	<li>Complimentary annual health screenings and gift cards for all employees who improve their health scores on that annual assessment, plus a drawing for a $1,000 gift card to reward health improvements</li>
	<li>Quarterly chair massages open to everyone</li>
	<li>Complimentary counseling service through our Unum Work-Life Balance Program</li>
</ul>

		<title>Chicago Area Full-Service IT Solutions Providers’ Internship Program</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/careers/chicago-full-service-it-solutions-providers-internship-program</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am very proud of SWC’s Internship Program. We offer paid internships to students who are currently enrolled in a college or university and are in good standing. SWC gives students the opportunity to learn and broaden their skills sets through our human resources, marketing, sales and technology-focused internships. We hire hardworking, highly-qualified candidates that we feel fit our corporate culture well. SWC’s Internship Program is a mutually beneficial experience. Our interns are given meaningful tasks that have an impact on our business and as a result, we do hire many interns as full-time employees from this program.

Here’s what our current interns have said about their experience and what they have learned working at SWC:

Great internships are often hard to find, especially those that provide an excellent learning experience for students in the field of their choice. In most cases, interns are not given the real-world experience necessary to succeed in future positions. As interns at SWC Technology Partners, we are thankful for this excellent opportunity that we have been given to gain extensive real-world experience and to see what a motivational employee culture is all about.

It is difficult not to notice the excellent working environment at SWC. There are smiling faces at every door eager to help in any situation regardless of their position or rank in the company. It has been so motivating to work with people who love their jobs and are excited to start their day at SWC. As interns, we have been welcomed into the culture and were able to attend the several events that have been held this summer. The most recent was the Chicago Cubs outing to Wrigley Field where we got to enjoy an exciting game and delicious food with our colleagues and friends.

We also had the privilege this summer to plan the 2012 SWC Olympic Games. This was an employee competition that consisted of two weeks’ worth of exciting events. It was a wonderful experience for us to learn how a business operated and to manage a project from start to finish. It was thrilling to get to plan and organize each event. SWC was eager to let us contribute our creative input. We were so thankful too that our ideas were heard by upper management and allowed to be executed. We did not expect to have this much autonomy and voice as interns.

As a Human Resource intern, you really get the chance to focus on learning and understanding each step of the recruiting process. You gain the necessary people skills to discuss positions openly with potential candidates. You also get to work on exciting HR projects in support of company needs. Teamwork is a key factor in any section of the company, but the HR department especially values the need to work in a team. This is a great opportunity that has provided the groundwork of experience needed to help us to exceed expectations in future positions.

As a Marketing intern there always is a chance for learning and developing essential marketing tools. As a crucial part of the marketing team you work with potential clients and update information in the database. You get to attend the many luncheons the company holds by assisting in preparation and event details. The marketing team is always observant of your interests and works hard to give you experience in each of those areas. This internship allows you to experience different aspects of marketing which will help you to excel in the future.

This company has not only helped us to expand our knowledge and professional experience, but has shown us the direction we would like to take our careers. Without SWC, we might have been trapped in a company that only trusted us to pick up their coffee. Thankfully, we were trusted and supported along our journey. We are so grateful to have had this experience that prepared us for the future ahead. We would like to thank all of our mentors for their continued help and support.

– Sarah Derry, Andrew Mullins, Marne Warda

		<title>My Favorite Features of Hyper-V 3.0 on Windows Server 2012</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The recent release of <a title="Microsoft Hyper-V" href="/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v">Hyper-V</a> 3.0 on Windows Server 2012 is very exciting to all of us in the <a title="Virtualization" href="/solutions/virtualization">virtualization</a> industry. I was lucky to get my hands on the product early and thought I would share my top five favorite features and of course, the benefits of Hyper-V 3.0 on Windows Server 2012. We will also be discussing these in more depth at our next Chicago area <a title="Chicago Virtualization Event" href="/html/email/virtualization/event/8302012-virtualization.html" target="_blank">virtualization event</a> on August 30, 2012.
<h2>Hyper-V Replica</h2>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Replicates virtual machines between Hyper-V 3.0 hosts.
<strong>Why it’s cool:</strong> Because our engineer testing it exclaimed, “This is awesome!”…No, really, it’s cool because you can replicate your virtual machines from your production site to your alternate/recovery site – all with the built-in capabilities of Hyper-V 3.0.
<strong>Why it matters for business:</strong> If you’ve been holding off on a pragmatic disaster recovery plan due to cost and complexity, Hyper-V Replica would be a great solution upon which to build your DR strategy.
<h2>Storage Live Migration</h2>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Migrates Hyper-V virtual disks from one storage array to another without any downtime.
<strong>Why it’s cool:</strong> Our engineers have been drooling over this feature ever since they saw it on a competing product. It’s built into the base functionality of Hyper-V 3.0, which means you don’t have to fork over a fortune for an upgraded license to take advantage of this “premium” feature.
<strong>Why it matters for business:</strong> Next time you invest in a shiny new SAN and want to quickly make use out of that investment, use the Storage Live Migration feature instead of manually copying things around. You’ll be glad you listened….you’re welcome.
<h2>Shared-Nothing Live Migration</h2>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Live-migrates virtual machines between hosts without shared storage.
<strong>Why it’s cool:</strong> This is a cool bonus feature that is actually quite useful. And yep, it’s built into Hyper-V 3.0.
<strong>Why it matters for business:</strong> If you want to virtualize your servers and don’t have enough dough for a SAN at the moment, you can now take advantage of the planned downtime benefits of server virtualization without a SAN using Hyper-V 3.0.
<h2>SMB File Share Support</h2>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Deploys Hyper-V over SMB (Server Message Block – Microsoft’s file sharing protocol) version 3.0. Hyper-V can now store virtual machine files on your network shares.
<strong>Why it’s cool:</strong> This is the icing on the cake (which, by the way is the most coveted part of cake in my household!) Microsoft really didn’t have to add this functionality, but now that they have, it just makes a lot of sense.
<strong>Why it matters for business:</strong> If you want to quickly get up and running with <a title="VMware Virtualization" href="/solutions/virtualization/vmware">virtualization</a> and start piloting the technology using your file server infrastructure, this feature nicely fits the bill.
<h2>Live Snapshot Management</h2>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Merges and purges virtual machine snapshots on the fly.
<strong>Why it’s cool:</strong> VM snapshots are very useful, but Hyper-V admins really disliked the fact that with the previous version, you had to take the VM offline in order to manage the snapshots. Well, Redmond heard the groans loud and clear! You can now clean up your snapshots while the VM is running. Tell your admins about this improvement, and then take two steps back and watch them jump up and down with unbridled joy….
<strong>Why it matters for business:</strong> If you have business-critical virtual machines that must run 24x7, and you’ve hesitated applying important patches due to the lack of an easy way to back out, this feature will make it much more manageable to keep those machines running in tiptop shape.

		<title>The Top Features of Microsoft System Center 2012</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-system-center/top-features-microsoft-system-center-2012</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This year, SWC has had quite a few events focused on <a title="Microsoft System Center" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center 2012</a>. This is Microsoft’s comprehensive management platform which gives <a title="Chicago IT Professionals" href="http://www.swc.com">IT professionals</a> the power to easily and efficiently manage their IT environments. <a title="Microsoft System Center 2012" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">System Center 2012</a> empowers your IT staff, by giving them a common management toolset for your organization’s private and public cloud applications and services, helping you confidently deliver IT as a service for your business. In this blog, I thought I would share a few of the features I really like for those of you who may be debating whether Microsoft System Center 2012 is a good solution for your organization.

The first Microsoft System Center 2012 feature I like is its User-Centric Management. The User-Centric Management feature gives users the ability to access their applications on all of the different devices they log on to. They can also take this feature to the next level and set-up different software policies for each device. For instance, someone may need to access all of their applications on their primary desktop computer, but may also need applications on their mobile device while they complete work at client sites. User-Centric Management is the perfect solution for this scenario. Additionally, I think users are surprised at how easy this feature is to use.

The second Microsoft System Center 2012 feature I like is its dependency-based software distribution. This is a great application management tool, which is responsible for defining and setting deployment rules on all of your users’ many devices. For instance, this rule will ensure that there is enough space on a user’s device and that all required software pre-requisites are met before a user can install any new hardware or software. The dependency-based software tool makes IT’s job a lot easier.

The third Microsoft System Center 2012 feature I like is its software portal, which delivers non-critical applications to users in an on demand webpage fashion. Users can then install the specific applications they want on their own, without having to bother or ask IT. IT managers also have the ability to push out applications to certain user and device groups, tailoring them to the specific needs and job functions of the users.

The Fourth Microsoft System Center 2012 feature I like is its smartphone support. As I previously mentioned, System Center is a comprehensive management platform, meaning it gives you the ability to manage all of your devices, which includes smartphones. One small disclaimer though, smartphone support is “lite management” and can only be used through an Exchange Active Sync connector. To gain more flexibility and ‘Full Management’ of your mobile devices, consider implementing a PKI Infrastructure and installing certificates on your mobile devices. This will then allow you to push the Configuration Manager Client to your devices providing richer management capabilities.

Finally, I really like the fact that we can now manage our storage, networking, and any other underlying fabric from within System Center 2012. System Center 2012 allows us to capture and aggregate knowledge about the infrastructure, policies, processes and best practices, and allows businesses to optimize IT structures, reduce costs, improve application availability and enhance service delivery. System Center 2012 is designed to bring cloud benefits to the enterprise datacenter.

To learn more about how Microsoft System Center 2012 can help you and your Chicago business, please join SWC Technology Partners for our next Chicago area <a title="Microsoft System Center Events" href="/events">Microsoft System Center event</a>.

		<title>Chicago Area IT Solutions Provider SWC Focuses On Work-Life Balance</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/careers/chicago-it-solutions-provider-work-life-balance</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firms</a> talk about work-life balance throughout the interview process, then you find yourself in an IT position where you’re traveling to various different client’s sites across the country, feeling the pressure to constantly be “on” and never having the chance to power off your business pager, laptop or smartphone. You may only work “40 hours” on the actual client project, but that’s in addition to your regularly scheduled travel time, endless client meetings and always worrying about their status, 24/7. At SWC Technology Partners, we really do have work-life balance and it is what sets us apart as an <a title="IT Consulting Company" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting company</a>. Located just minutes from Chicago in Oak Brook, IL, our IT consultants only travel locally (Chicago area) to client’s sites, as needed. At the end of the day our IT consultants go home to their families, not an empty hotel room.

So what does work-life balance really mean for you and your <a title="Chicago IT Careers" href="/careers">IT career</a>? At SWC we promote a healthy work-life balance program which encourages our employees to efficiently complete work in a 40 - 45 hour workweek, while offering flex time and alternate work schedules. Our IT consultants work extremely hard during the week. The office is a fast-paced, busy environment that requires team members to focus, and simultaneously balance multiple projects. However, at the end of the day and on weekends, we encourage our employees to go home and decompress, and to spend quality time with their families and friends. During this time away from the office, we do not want our employees to worry about what’s going on back at the office. At SWC, we believe downtime is critical – it allows employees to go home to refresh, regenerate and then come back to the office energized and ready to work. SWC views this downtime as a true value. Time outside the office environment is not only important for our employees’ personal health, but for the overall health of the company. We are committed to our client’s success and that means a determined effort, but there is no reason that we can’t have fun along the way.

Another important aspect of work-life balance is personal growth. At SWC, we have many employees involved in a number of community-based initiatives, as well as family-related and recreational activities. SWC proudly promotes a family-oriented environment, and this includes supporting employees who may be little league coaches, or their child’s soccer or basketball coach. SWC encourages this important aspect of family life, and never tries to hinder it. By offering our consultants a very adaptable work environment that accommodates these personal and family-related commitments, SWC believes a healthy balance between both work and home can exist. We recognize that our team members have personal lives and responsibilities outside of the work environment, and we continually strive to create a healthy, happy, engaging and fun atmosphere, both inside and outside the office. As the SWC family continues to expand, we continue to work hard to maintain that personal, family feel, and make it a goal that our company’s priorities realistically align with our employee’s priorities.

We have learned that leadership needs to be open to the idea of flexibility. Just because an employee leaves the office before 5:00 pm doesn’t mean the work won’t get done. It just may mean making a few adjustments to accommodate that particular team member. Figure out a solution to potential barriers that come up and move forward. There’s always a way to make it work, and both the company and the consultants will be happier at the end of the day. Please connect with me on <a title="Fran Peters LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/fran-peters-phr/19/a70/154" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, if you have any other great ideas on work-life balance to share.

If you are looking to make a change and find work-life balance in your IT career, please contact SWC today. You can also visit our careers page to watch our employee videos and browse our open <a title="Chicago IT Positions" href="/careers">Chicago area IT positions</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Upon graduating college, I had plenty of options to pursue a career in a variety of different industries. Many of my friends chose to go to larger companies that recruited heavily at my school, and while that was great for them, I’d like to share why I was drawn to the technology industry and specifically, Chicago area <a title="Chicago IT Solutions Provider" href="/swc-technology-partners/about-swc">IT solutions provider</a>, SWC Technology Partners.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Technology is ever changing.</strong> Working in the technology industry means always being on the cusp of what’s new. From a salesperson’s perspective, this means I’m able to have new and interesting discussions with my customers all the time. A solution that may not have been right for them in an older version may be just the right solution for them now, and I’m able to facilitate that decision process.</li>
	<li><strong>I’m helping customers solve real life issues.</strong> As an account manager for SWC, I am not selling a commodity… I’m selling a relationship. My customers have real life business challenges they are trying to overcome, and it’s my job to help them find the solutions and services that will best address those concerns. We are not successful unless our clients are successful, and it means a lot to me when I get to make a difference for my customer.</li>
	<li><strong>I work with intelligent people.</strong> John Wooden is quoted as saying, “Whatever you do in life, surround yourself with smart people…” At SWC, I benefit daily from the shared insight and education I receive from my colleagues and superiors. I appreciate the patience and effort of the practice leaders here who go above and beyond to help me understand our solution areas better.</li>
	<li><strong>We are family.</strong> I know it sounds cheesy, but I have made some very solid relationships with people in the office. The people that work at SWC are genuinely good folks, many of whom I am happy to call my friends. We share lunches, birthdays, and other life events... I will never forget when my work comrades organized a surprise wedding shower for me last year… and actually surprised me. It really meant a lot.</li>
</ol>
For these reasons and more, I am delighted with my choice to work in the technology industry, and to have found a company like SWC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a title="Private Cloud" href="/blog/microsoft-system-center/top-features-microsoft-system-center-2012">Private Cloud</a> is a new IT model that allows organizations to better pool, provision and scale their infrastructure. It allows organizations to focus on the services that provide value to the business rather than the underlying fabric that is needed to deploy those services. Simply put, a Private Cloud delivers business functions as services. The ‘<a title="CRM Cloud" href="/blog/customer-relationship-management/choosing-the-right-crm-solution-part-ii">Cloud</a>’ is nothing mystical; don’t feed into all the hype. The cloud is simply a more efficient way to utilize your infrastructure and resources to deploy services throughout your organization. It is geared toward allowing organizations to focus more on the service offering to the organization rather than the storage, networking, servers and other underlying fabric that are used to provide these offerings.

When we speak about ‘Services’ in a Private <a title="Windows 8 Cloud" href="/swc-technology-partners/news/microsoft-windows-8-consumerization-meets-its-match">Cloud</a>, we are really talking about Applications that are encapsulated with all of the necessary configurations, Operating System files and underlying fabric that is needed to deploy those applications within the organization. Long gone are the days of configuring a single purposed physical server for a Line of Business Application you may have; not to mention all of the overhead associated in configuring and maintaining the networking, storage and security aspects that are needed to support the application. By the time you are done you have incurred much more time and cost in setting up the infrastructure than actually working on deploying the application to the organization. This time and cost is then magnified should you ever need to reconfigure the application or server hardware for whatever reason. The Private Cloud concept was built to address these shortcomings, and allows for a much more versatile, scalable and manageable compute environment.

The proliferation of the Private Cloud is built around concepts such as Self-Service, Resource Pooling, Elasticity and Analytics. All of which are achieved by leveraging the underlying technologies you use in your organization today; such as <a title="Chicago Virtualization" href="/solutions/virtualization">Virtualization</a>, High Availability and Shared Storage. We can now begin to shift our attention away from the individual components that make up your infrastructure and begin to focus more on providing the services and applications that provide value to your organization.

The Private Cloud allows us to provision only the resources we require for a given service, and encompasses the necessary security access, hardware resources, and deployment methods required by those services, while being totally geographically independent. That’s right, the Private Cloud isn’t limited to a single location, but rather it is defined by a collection of resources within your organizations jurisdiction. So whether you manage the cloud resources yourself in-house or subscribe to a cloud hosting service, or both; System Center 2012 has the tools and capabilities to provide a robust, efficient, manageable and scalable Private Cloud.

To learn more about how <a title="Microsoft System Center 2012" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center 2012</a> can help you and your Chicago business, please join <a title="IT Solutions Provider" href="/swc-technology-partners/about-swc">IT solutions provider</a>, SWC Technology Partners for our next <a title="Chicago Microsoft System Center Events" href="/events">Chicago area Microsoft System Center event</a>.

		<title>Microsoft SharePoint 2013 and the Modern Office Experience</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-2013-modern-office-experience</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft has recently released the preview versions of several key products, including Office 2013 and <a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint 2013</a>. <a title="IT Solutions Provider" href="/swc-technology-partners/about-swc">IT solutions provider</a>, SWC has been hard at work reviewing the new technologies, in order to determine which improvements will provide the most benefit to our clients.

A lot of the changes in SharePoint seem fairly evolutionary – after all, it has been around since 2001 and is now a mature product. While Microsoft has certainly provided many exciting enhancements in SharePoint 2013, one thing seems clear – the platform will continue to provide the same bottom-line business value that it has for some time now. It's still all about connecting people, information and tools with each other, in order to enhance information worker productivity. That means that the same challenges still exist, and the same fundamental approach to success is required.

The potential for a more revolutionary change comes in to play when you look at the synergy between the 'next wave' of products, including Office 2013, <a title="Microsoft Lync" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2010">Lync 2013</a>, <a title="Microsoft Exchange" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2010">Exchange 2013</a> and <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Windows 8</a>. Microsoft calls this the 'Modern Office Experience' – a convergence of productivity, mobile, cloud and social capabilities across all kinds of hardware, including desktop, laptop, ultrabook, tablet and phone devices. Other new products like the Microsoft Surface tablet are going to give users the same full-featured Office capabilities as on the desktop. More importantly, it will be fully connected, highly manageable and enterprise-ready!

Microsoft might be poised for a big comeback with the next wave of 2013 products and the 'Modern Office Experience'. While I love my iPad and iPhone, the concept of running the full Office suite and other Windows applications all on my devices is very exciting. And, since cloud syncing facilitates seamless data and content sharing across devices – all of the time – I will be able to access any application, anytime I want, with better social, communications and search integration than ever before.

If you are interested in learning more about Microsoft SharePoint please join us for our next informative <a title="Chicago Microsoft SharePoint Event" href="/events">Microsoft SharePoint event</a> or follow <a title="Jeff Lanham LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeff-lanham/22/125/a99" target="_blank">Jeff Lanham on LinkedIn</a>. You can also watch our <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Services" href="/perspective/videos/microsoft-sharepoint-services" target="_blank">Microsoft SharePoint Services</a> video to understand how SWC delivers <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Solutions" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint solutions</a> that drive adoption, satisfaction and success. In business the power to share is a fundamental component to success and at SWC Technology Partners, we are helping our Chicago area clients become more productive through collaboration.

		<title>How Microsoft System Center 2012 Manages the Private Cloud</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-system-center/how-ms-system-center-2012-manages-private-cloud</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my last blog post I explained what the <a title="Private Cloud" href="/blog/microsoft-system-center/what-is-the-private-cloud">Private Cloud</a> was. So now I wanted to discuss how we create this Private Cloud and how we manage it. <a title="Microsoft System Center 2012" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft’s System Center 2012</a> is designed and built around the concept of the Private Cloud and provides a complete toolkit for your organization to create your very own Private Cloud.

Here are the System Center tools that allow organizations to adapt their very own Private Cloud:
<h2>System Center Virtual Machine Managers (SCVMM)</h2>
Virtual Machine manager is a pivotal tool in creating and managing your Private Clouds. VMM allows you to create and manage multiple Private Clouds based on your organization’s needs, and enables you to set security scopes for each cloud you create. SCVMM also allows you to provision all of the underlying fabric such as: Networking, Storage, Security, <a title="Virtualization Chicago" href="/solutions/virtualization">Virtualization</a> and orchestrated software patching. Once the fabric has been configured we can then create and deploy entire services from the VMM Console or Web Console. Further, you can set Quota Points for the amount of resources your cloud users can utilize when deploying services or VM’s to your clouds. This ensures your environment doesn’t become over capacitated. Finally, SCVMM allows you to manage your <a title="Microsoft Hyper-V" href="/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v">HyperV</a>, <a title="VMware Virtualization" href="/solutions/virtualization/vmware">VMware</a> and <a title="Virtualization Citrix" href="/solutions/virtualization/citrix-xenapp">Citrix</a> Zen Server Hypervisors. This allows organizations to become more flexible and better prepared to support multiple Hypervisors. Say you are acquiring a company that uses VMware, and your current environment is based around HyperV. Thanks to VMM 2012, we can simply attach the VMware clusters to VMM within minutes and begin managing and provisioning them.
<h2>System Center Application Controller (SCAC)</h2>
Application Controller is a superset of features that ride on top of VMM. Application Controller allows you to manage your Private Clouds like VMM, but it also allows you to manage any Microsoft Online Services you may have, such as Windows Azure. In larger environments with multiple VMM servers, Application Controller can manage all of the VMM servers from one console. You can then share content from different VMM Libraries, move VM’s from cloud to cloud (even if they are on different VMM servers, or mixed between onsite clouds and hosted clouds), and create and deploy services to any of the VMM servers and clouds you have configured. Finally, the web console in Application Controller allows you to deploy services and VM’s; the VMM web console only allows you to deploy VM’s. By configuring security scopes based on your needs and by deploying services through the web console, you have greatly reduced the time it takes to deploy entire solutions to your organization, while maintaining a high level of security.
<h2>System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)</h2>
System Center Configuration Manager is becoming the industry standard for desktop deployment and management. SCCM is a powerhouse when it comes to Operating System Deployment, Application Deployment, Mobile Device Management, Patch Management and Asset Management. Included in SCCM 2012 is Microsoft’s Endpoint Protection, which is Microsoft’s solution for antivirus and antimalware. SCCM now allows administrators to deploy very robust and flexible Endpoint Policies to the desktop. The SCCM integrated console now gives you access to manage every aspect of your desktop management. But we’re talking Private Cloud right? How does SCCM fit in?

<strong>What does this means for the Private Cloud?</strong>
SCCM isn’t a cloud solution per say, but it does however provide many features to the System Center tools that do provide your Private Cloud services. I have listed some of these features below.
<ul>
	<li>SCCM provides orchestrated patching to your VMM host machines. What’s even better is that it gives access to the PXE Services, OS Deployment Services and Software Update Services that VMM can then use to deploy baremetal servers from scratch and manage them throughout their lifecycle.</li>
	<li>SCCM can deploy AppV Applications, MSI, Mobile Cabinet Files and OSX applications (In SP1) which we can use to deploy to the resources in our Private Cloud.</li>
</ul>
<h2>System Center Orchestrator (SCO)</h2>
Orchestrator is a workflow management solution for the datacenter. It allows organizations to automate many of the mundane tasks that are inherent in any environment. Orchestrator gives your Private Cloud an efficiency boost as we can now automate thousands of tasks throughout the entire System Center Suite, Active Directory, and many 3rd party vendors and products. By doing this, we free up the time of our engineers to focus on more strategic tasks relating to the organization's IT environment rather than creating user accounts, deploying software, configuring backups, configuring alerting, or manually configuring VM’s. Simply download the proper Orchestrator Integration Packs, configure your Runbooks, set your schedules, and sit back and relax and watch as Orchestrator makes quick work for all of the repetitive tasks in your current environment.

For example, let’s say we have a single Orchestrator Runbook that we’ve created. In that Runbook, we can create, configure and deploy a VM, install software on that VM, create an AD User Account, add the user to specific Security Groups, and then link the new VM to the new User Account in SCCM. The user logs in to the new VM and is off and running within minutes. Your creativity and organizational needs are the ingredients needed to create a very powerful and robust Orchestrator Deployment. But how can we leverage Orchestrator for your Private Cloud?

<strong>What does this means for the Private Cloud?</strong>
As you begin your journey to you own Private Cloud, you will find yourself doing the same tasks over and over. Things like creating AD accounts, creating VM Templates and configuring backups for your new resources will consume much of your time; and will create inefficiencies along the way. By utilizing Orchestrator 2012 you can now automate these processes in an accurate and controlled manner, allowing you to focus on more strategic tasks.
<h2>System Center Operations Manager (SCOM)</h2>
Operations Manager is a comprehensive and robust monitoring and alerting platform. We can monitor and alert on Windows, Unix and Linux devices. But that’s only the beginning! We can also monitor networking devices, and.NET and ASP has been added to SCOM’s Application Monitoring capabilities. With the new features of custom Dashboards and Security Roles, we can create granular dashboards and scope them to the appropriate audience. The SCOM hierarchy is Highly Available right out of the box in 2012! No need for Microsoft Clustering and added complexity for a Highly Available SCOM implementation. Did I mention that it has a web console too! But how does this assist in your move toward your Private Cloud?

<strong>What does this means for the Private Cloud?</strong>
In terms of your Private Cloud, SCOM can group resources based on their roles and monitor accordingly. Say you have just deployed four Exchange Services in your Private Cloud. We can group the Exchange Servers in SCOM and install the Exchange 2012 Management Pack and scope it to this group. Within minutes, we are monitoring all of the critical process and services for the Exchange Servers running in your Private Cloud. As your cloud grows, rest assured knowing that SCOM is there to monitor and alert on all of the critical pieces that make up your cloud environment from the physical network all the way up to your applications.

		<title>Microsoft Windows Expert Answers Windows 8 Questions</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My colleague, Mike Romp and I have been hosting monthly events on <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Microsoft Windows 8</a> and are very excited about the product’s official release on October 26th. Mike has been using Windows 8 on his tablet, since the preview was released in February, so I thought I would have him answer some common Windows 8 questions our customers have been asking.

<strong><a title="Microsoft Windows" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</a> 8’s new features have a heavy focus on touch screens, what will users who have not upgraded their hardware get from the new OS?</strong>

While many of the improvements in Windows 8 focus on touch-centric UI improvements, there are several new features that will benefit users of non-touch hardware.

First, Windows 8 is faster than its predecessor in startup times – much faster. This is due to Windows 8’s ability to hibernate just the system kernel. Windows 8 will also run on any machine capable of running Windows 7.

Second, users who upgrade can run the new <a title="IT Professionals Microsoft Windows 8" href="/blog/microsoft-windows/what-it-professionals-saying-about-microsoft-windows-8">Windows 8</a> applications. This probably won’t be a deciding factor for many organizations, but the number of Windows 8 applications is expanding every day. Eventually, users will be able to run the exact same applications across all devices, from desktops to tablets to smartphones.

Windows 8 provides much better multi-monitor support. Multiple monitors are becoming increasingly prevalent in today’s workforce, and Windows 8 finally addresses this from a UI level. Not only can users apply different background images to different monitors, but the taskbar can now be duplicated across all monitors. Additionally, Windows 8 applications can run alongside legacy desktop applications when using a multiple monitor setup.

Finally, there are a lot of minor tweaks that probably won’t affect the average user, but will really improve the desktop experience for us tech folk. Client <a title="Microsoft Hyper-V" href="/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v">Hyper-V</a> finally brings a real hypervisor to the client OS. The improved Windows Explorer along with its enhanced file copy dialog makes a lot of everyday IT tasks a lot more streamlined. And then there are the little under-the-hood things like native USB 3.0 support.

It’s important to note that even if a company isn’t ready to jump in with both feet, it still has the option of rolling out a hybrid Windows 8 deployment. These organizations can choose to upgrade only the executive and mobile workforce, while leaving the rest of the company on Windows 7. The same deployment infrastructures used for upgrading to Windows 7 can be easily extended to support Windows 8.

<strong>What types of organizations can benefit from an immediate upgrade to Windows 8 and what types of organizations should wait?</strong>

Since one of Windows 8’s main focuses is on mobility, any organization with a significant mobile workforce will benefit from Windows 8. The tablet form-factor is here to stay; however, the selection of tablets prior to Windows 8’s arrival had a paltry array of enterprise and line-of-business applications. Windows 8 finally combines the convenience and empowerment of mobility with the productivity and security of an enterprise-grade operating system.

Organizations with a large, static workforce could probably hold off on Windows 8 for a while. While there are definite improvements, it may be hard for these companies to justify the additional user training that will be required for Windows 8.

<strong>What factors should a company considering upgrading to Windows 8 take into account?</strong>

Any organization looking to upgrade to Windows 8, or even <a title="Microsoft Windows 7" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-7">Windows 7</a>, should consider their current deployment infrastructure. The old block-level, hardware-dependent imaging solutions of the past should be replaced with intelligent, hardware-agnostic deployment solutions.

For companies with a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, the natural choice is <a title="Microsoft System Center" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center</a> Configuration Manager. For companies with tighter budgets, the freely-available Microsoft Deployment Toolkit fits the bill. Both of these products allow for simplified and automated image deployment, as well as integration with the User State Migration Toolkit to ensure that all user data and preferences are transferred during the upgrade process.

		<title>My Favorite Features of Hyper-V 3.0 on Windows Server 2012 – Part Two</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/virtualization/favorite-features-hyper-v-windows-server-2012-part-two</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last month I wrote a blog discussing my top five favorite <a title="Favorite Features Of Hyper-V 3.0" href="/blog/virtualization/favorite-features-hyper-v-windows-server-2012">features of Hyper-V 3.0 on Windows Server 2012</a>. The blog was very popular, so popular that I have created a second blog on more of my favorite Hyper-V 3.0 features.
<h2>Incremental Backups</h2>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Track changed blocks of VM disks for improved backup efficiency
<strong>Why it’s cool:</strong> Whenever I speak at an event, I like to ask the audience thought-provoking questions such as, “Are the White Sox a better ball club than the Cubs?”, or “ Will the Bears beat the Packers?”, or better yet, “Who here loves managing server backups?”. There’s usually an impassioned shouting match with the first two questions, but the third one stumps us all and keeps everyone in the audience very quiet. I’d like to think this is because my questions are profound, but the reality of the situation is that nobody likes dealing with backups. NOBODY! So anything that takes some of the sting out of backups is always welcome. <a title="Microsoft Hyper-V Solutions" href="/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v">Hyper-V</a> 3.0 drastically improves backup efficiency thanks to the built-in ability to track changed blocks of virtual hard disks. Supported backup software can then back up just the changed blocks, slashing the time it takes to back up your VMs.
<strong>Why it matters for business:</strong> Your backups are the defensive linemen against would-be-disasters. Improving the efficiency and quality of the backups and thereby enhancing the business’ ability to recover from an outage will make you a hero.
<h2>Offloaded Data Transfer (ODX)</h2>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Achieve near-native copy performance of large amounts of data by offloading the operations to the storage device
<strong>Why it’s cool:</strong> If you’ve ever tried to perform virtual hard disk maintenance tasks such as merge, move and compact, you know how painfully slow they can be. Offloaded Data Transfer (ODX) in Hyper-V 3.0, when used with “copy offload” capable SAN hardware, lets the storage system perform the large file copy operations without the Hyper-V host reading the content from one storage array and write it to another.
<strong>Why it matters for business:</strong> Get the most out of your Hyper-V host and storage hardware, which translates to lower CAPEX and OPEX.
<h2>Virtual Fibre Channel Support for VM</h2>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Access Fibre Channel SAN LUNs directly from VMs
<strong>Why it’s cool:</strong> Let’s face it: Fibre Channel (FC) SAN is not cheap. Although iSCSI has gained in popularity, FC isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. If you have invested in FC SAN, you’ll be happy to know that now with Hyper-V 3.0, you can access the LUNs directly from the VMs, which extends the usefulness of the investment. For example, if you have systems that use direct access to FC storage and want to keep it that way, you can virtualize such workloads with Hyper-V. Support for FC in Hyper-V includes guest OS clustering, live migration, multi-path IO (MPIO), and N_Port ID <a title="Virtualization Services" href="/virtualization">Virtualization</a> (NPIV), opening up new ways to leverage your investment.
<strong>Why it matters for business:</strong> Let your CFO know that you’ll be repurposing your existing hardware to improve the ROI and TCO. You might actually get that bump in the IT budget that you’ve been looking for. Everyone wins.
<h2>Dynamic Memory Improvements</h2>
<strong>What it is:</strong> Significantly improved virtual machine memory management
<strong>Why it’s cool:</strong> Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 introduced dynamic memory for Hyper-V. In Windows Server 2012, significant improvements have been added to dynamic memory including Hyper-V Smart Paging for a more reliable VM restarts and the ability to change dynamic memory configuration on the fly. These improvements result in better VM density per host, reliability of Hyper-V operations, and a more flexible infrastructure.
<strong>Why it matters for business:</strong> Your VP of Finance will like the fact that you are right-sizing the hardware instead over-buying “just in case.” Improving the reliability of the server infrastructure will make everyone happy.
<h2>Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) Support for VM</h2>
<strong>What it is:</strong> NUMA support for VMs increases memory access performance
<strong>Why it’s cool:</strong> The basic concept of NUMA is that a processor can access memory that is local to itself faster than memory that is remote (on another processor). With NUMA improvements in Hyper-V 3.0, the guest OS and applications can make intelligent decisions for efficient memory mapping. Got a resource-hungry, NUMA-aware workloads like Microsoft SQL Server? NUMA can help you get even more juice out of that SQL VM.
<strong>Why it matters for business:</strong> Make your customers and business units happy by improving performance of demanding applications.

Adoption is not only vital for staff members and the continuity of data; but it also is the ultimate driver of revenue and customer satisfaction.
<h2>Making a Plan</h2>
To increase the odds of widespread usage, companies need to have a sustained adoption plan in place before launch. For some organizations, the use of a new CRM platform can be a significant shift in processes and even culture. Management first needs to tell staff that a change is coming and then provide the business case for the new system and what are the expected longer-term results. Some vendors will work closely with a company to help them educate staff and to generate excitement about the product. They might create customized videos or intuitive guidebooks to alleviate any initial concerns about the switch to CRM.

Firms that are working with a top <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a> for implementation should feel the focus of the conversation is more about process than it is technology. A quality consulting outfit will focus initial conversations on what exact tasks and goals the sales, marketing and other teams need to complete on a daily basis. Company management and the consultants should present CRM as a tool instead of a task, and explicitly state the value statement before actual launch.
<h2>Adoption Starts at the Top</h2>
Once launched, the adoption of a CRM platform should be a top-down approach, meaning executive and manager-level staff need to be the frontrunners using the solution. If they are active users and participants they are not only leading by example, but are also able to describe and quantify the business value of the platform. One way of showing the inherent value is to encourage the management of data all in one place. In a sales environment, sales managers need to fully embrace the CRM to pull forecast reports and other needed data. Typical disconnects in some organizations find the sales manager asking for individual Excel sheets from each sales member that must then be aggregated. This is the type of situation that the right <a title="Chicago CRM Solutions" href="/solutions/crm">CRM solution</a> should render obsolete, the double entry of information. Management needs to invest their own time in learning the system in order to have the trickle down adoption and resulting efficiency gains from their team members.

Another tactic to drive adoption is to introduce a phased approach, where an organization might offer the CRM to the department where adoption is likely to be highest. Once some “super users” are identified and encouraged, the company can develop usage cases to clearly show the value of the CRM platform to other departments.

Once launched, some staff members might complain there is not yet enough data within the CRM for them to actually do tangible work. Management needs things for the staff to complete right away. Creating a “competition” is a good tactic, especially in a sales setting where a level of competition already exists. Managers could offer coffee gift cards or some other reward for the sales staff who inserts the most prospect customers into the system within a certain time frame. Or marketing staff bonuses could be held back until all campaigns are placed into the CRM tool.
<h2>Choosing the Right CRM to Drive Adoption – Salesforce.com and Microsoft Dynamics</h2>
For the business that needs several integrated apps in order to conduct core business functions, Salesforce.com is leading the way with their own app marketplace and exchange. <a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM" href="/solutions/crm">Microsoft Dynamics</a> also is driving forward with app integration, but it does not yet have the breadth found with <a title="Salesforce.com CRM" href="/solutions/crm">Salesforce.com</a>. They have very quickly opened up to the usage of third-party apps which can add more value to marketing, sales, or service. For example, CRM tools usually have basic functions for email campaigns, but are mainly relying on third-party partners such as Marketo which allows the business to create campaigns, track customer behavior, and other functions.

Salesforce.com can be expensive, with user fees ranging from $65 to $250 per user per month, but it is embracing innovation and offers advanced features that bring value. Alternatively, Microsoft Dynamics On Demand version is only $44 per user per month.

Both solutions are becoming more accepting of the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) trend, with Salesforce.com users able to access any needed CRM data through their phone. This access is free, but a top tier subscription is required for customizations. Microsoft is announcing enhanced mobile capabilities in Q4 of this year, and access will likely have a $30 per user per month charge.

Microsoft Dynamics is a winner when it comes to on-premises capability (not an option with Salesforce.com) and document management capabilities which are managed through SharePoint.

Salesforce.com and Microsoft Dynamics are also moving towards becoming part of the “social enterprise,” where key business applications are built to allow easier sharing and team collaboration. Such features can drive adoption, but there are some hurdles, especially with sales teams that might compete with one another. With either solution, the rate of adoption still mainly rests with the efforts of individual users to find value and share their positive experience with others.

		<title>New Microsoft Lync 2013 Server Features</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/unified-communications/new-microsoft-lync-2013-server-features</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Lync 2013 preview has been released and as an avid user and a presenter at SWC’s Events for <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications Solutions" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications</a>, I wanted to highlight some of the new features we can look forward to. If you’re not as familiar with <a title="Microsoft Lync Provider" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2010">Microsoft Lync</a> as you’d like to be, I’d like to invite you to one of our free webinars or luncheons, please keep an eye on the <a title="SWC IT Events" href="/events">SWC Events</a> page to register! For this post, most of the changes I will be discussing will be visible from the client level, stay tuned for the next one as we dive into other server enhancements that reduce the need for resources and enhance enterprise voice. As we move forward we’ll dive into each of these new features and more in more detail to show you how they work and how they can help your business. We’ll also keep you up to date as new announcements are made.
<h2>Tabbed Conversations</h2>
The Lync 2013 Client features the same ease of use as always, but comes with loads of new features. One of the first things you’ll notice is the tabbed conversations feature. You can navigate through all of your conversations in a single window; however you have to option to dock and undock these conversations as well, which can be handy during meetings with content you may want to maximize.
<h2>Persistent Chat</h2>
Lync 2013 now also includes the persistent chat feature right in the main client where users can keep conversations going even as they enter and leave. These chat rooms keep a history of the chat that you can come back to at any time. Notifications can easily be configured to alert you if someone writes new content in a room, or to alert you if specific keywords or your name is mentioned.
<h2>Unified Contact Store</h2>
With Exchange Server 2013 all of a user’s contacts can be merged into their Exchange mailbox. We can now manage their contacts not only from Lync, but from Outlook and Outlook Web App. This gives us the ability to have a single consolidated contact store for email, instant messaging, conferencing, desk phones, and mobile phones.
<h2>Native Skype and XMPP (Google Talk) Federation</h2>
You’ve all heard that Microsoft has acquired Skype, and with Lync 2013 federation with Skype is available out of the box. You can now communicate through Microsoft Lync with the hundreds of millions of worldwide users already using Skype! Further, Microsoft has removed the need for a gateway and it’s restrictions to communicate with XMPP systems. Lync 2013 can now natively chat with networks using the XMPP protocol including Google Talk!
<h2>Conferencing Enhancements</h2>
Conferencing has received a lot of attention in this iteration of Lync. Have you ever tried to share a PowerPoint deck or sales presentation through a video conference? Most of the time, end user see a low-resolution, barely legible image, or are unable to access it on their mobile devices. Lync 2013’s Office Web Apps Server now provides better PowerPoint capabilities at a higher-resolution across a greater array of mobile devices, including the Android, iPhone and Windows Phone. Additionally, all shared documents are now archived through Exchange 2013. How many times have you misplaced a document or had someone ask you to resend a presentation you gave months ago? Archived documents on Exchange can be quickly and easily searched, found and sent. Video has received its share of enhancements as well, including support for 1080p for those full room conferences. Audio and video can be split up now so you can use the webcam connected to your PC, while joining the audio portion of the conference with your desk or mobile phone. Perhaps the most noticeable feature is the new control over the video feeds; you have the ability to select gallery view where you can see up to five video streams at once, you can also lock video feeds so that they can be seen even when not talking. And while there are many new conferencing enhancements we’ll discuss in upcoming articles, I couldn’t miss the new Lync Web App. This client has greatly improved over the previous version allowing Windows and Mac users without a Lync client to join conferences and get the full experience including HD video, audio, instant messaging, desktop, application and presentation sharing.

SWC and our clients are very excited about the new wave of <a title="Unified Communications Products" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications products</a>. Keep us bookmarked to stay informed!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As <a title="IT Consultants" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consultants</a>, we are very excited about the <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Microsoft Windows 8</a> Release on October 26th and have been hosting events since June in anticipation. Our events have been attended by hundreds of midmarket IT professionals and business leaders who have had some very interesting things to say about Windows 8. Watch the video below to learn more and see what midmarket IT leaders are saying about Windows 8.

<a title="Chicago IT Director Talks Microsoft Windows 8" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dmE3Tyd4uso?autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-windows-8-release-event-500.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="380" /></a>

For this mid-market IT leader, Windows 8 is very intriguing; there are countless new features that he thinks improve the user experience. For instance, browsing has improved immensely, by being able to swipe through previous pages viewed. Also, the icons now allow you to scroll through data without having to open up an application. He thinks scroll through browsing makes finding data simple. Some concerns he has about Windows 8 are security and setting group policy. Being able to control the environment is important to rolling out a new operating system.

Subscribe to our blog and stay tuned, as SWC will continue to produce more Windows 8 videos at our events to share with you.

To learn more about how Microsoft Windows 8 can help you and your business, please join SWC Technology Partners for our next <a title="Microsoft Windows 8 Event Chicago" href="/events">Windows 8 event</a> or follow <a title="Pete Lee LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pete-lee/4/b2b/989" target="_blank">Pete Lee on LinkedIn</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SWC's <a title="IT Consultants" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consultants</a> Pete Lee and Mike Romp are hosting a <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Microsoft Windows 8</a> release event on October 26th, watch our video below to learn more about Windows 8.

<a title="Chicago IT Director Talks Microsoft Windows 8" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vJpZGJe2aHI?autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-windows-8-release-event-500.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="380" /></a>

Windows 8 is exciting because it bridges the gap between consumerization and the enterprise. We all hear those buzz words quite a bit, but tablets and mobile devices aren’t going away and there’s more and more competition out there on the market. We’re not saying that Windows 8 is going to replace something like the Apple or Android, but it will compliment them and be able to get your users more productive than ever before! From our experience Windows 8 has been tremendous, it’s easy to use, fluid and the learning curve from <a title="Microsoft Windows 7" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-7">Windows 7</a> to Windows 8 is relatively easy, as the desktop doesn’t change. Obviously everyone was concerned at first about the Windows 8 start menu, but once you start using it, you realize it’s not that drastic of a change. We think all of the other benefits that come with Windows 8 make it fully worthwhile, for instance there’s mobility and touchscreen fluidity with all of the control and security and enterprise level things that you need to actually get some work done.

The other thing we discuss at our event is a strategy for Windows 8 deployments, with Windows 7 and previous versions you had one platform you had to push out to just a desktop. But who uses just a desktop anymore? Looking at myself, I use four or five devices at one time – the smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and home PC. Now you have VDI with <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft Server 2012</a>, <a title="Citrix XenDesktop" href="/blog/virtualization/desktop-virtualization-higher-education">XenDesktop</a>, <a title="Application Virtualization" href="/solutions/virtualization">application virtualization</a>, <a title="VMware" href="/solutions/virtualization/vmware">VMware</a> View, and the list goes on and on.

We look forward to seeing you at our next event. To learn more about how Microsoft Windows 8 can help you and your Chicago area business, please join SWC for our next Microsoft Windows 8 event or follow <a title="Pete Lee LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pete-lee/4/b2b/989" target="_blank">Pete Lee on LinkedIn</a>.

To help provide information, education and a clearer understanding of what Microsoft's most innovative operating system means to businesses and how it will change the way people use not only their computers, but also tablets, SWC is making their Windows 8 experts available to media outlets for interviews.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SWC Technology Partners' <a title="Chicago Digital Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">Digital Design solution</a> provides website design and <a title="Chicago Search Engine Optimization Services" href="/solutions/digital-design/search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a> or SEO services to Chicago area businesses. In this Digital Design video blog, we discuss microsites and SWC’s approach to SEO and how both are helping our clients achieve online success.

<a title="Chicago SEO And Microsite Design Services" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ynmW-d1dWEg?autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/chicago-seo-microsite-design-services.png" alt="" width="500" height="277" /></a>

Through SEO, we learn so much about our clients, their competition, the market place and how their market strategies are or aren’t working. SWC’s approach to SEO is more than us just telling our clients what are the <a title="SEO Keyword Analysis" href="/solutions/digital-design/search-engine-optimization/seo-keyword-analysis">best keywords</a> for their businesses. We complete a detailed assessment and conduct a full <a title="SEO Competitive Analysis" href="/solutions/digital-design/search-engine-optimization/seo-competitive-analysis">competitive analysis</a>. As part of this assessment, we not only ask our clients what keywords they would like to target, but also show them what keywords their competition is targeting and which keywords people are using to search Google. This provides us with what we like to call “golden nuggets” of information, or a myriad of keywords that the client may not have considered targeting. We then create content around those keywords to help them to outrank their competition for those phrases. Sometimes in business, you are so focused on what your company is doing that you can’t see past your own prism. By looking at the competition, we find another way of looking at the marketplace, which is fascinating and helps to determine if your market strategy is working or failing and how you can achieve greater success.

Another issue we often encounter in an SEO assessment is that clients get stuck looking at their website and the experience in a singular way. They tell us, “We have this website and can only do SEO this way.” Sometimes they are limited by the platform they are using, such as a legacy platform, or because they are a huge company with a broad site that is already built out. We work with these clients to build a microsite strategy in a very SEO friendly platform like WordPress that helps to improve their rankings. A microsite is separate from your primary website and is a smaller site that generally consists of three to five pages, or even a single page designed around a smaller amount of specific keywords that you want to target. The microsite helps you rank better in the search engines for those terms. A great example would be if you want to target your services for a specific geographic location, i.e. Chicago Plumber or Oak Brook Consulting Firm.

		<title>Microsoft SharePoint Document Auto-Classification</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-document-auto-classification</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the great things about <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> is that it enhances your ability to quickly and easily find documents. It can free you from the confines of the folder structure and provide a variety of ways to locate important information quickly and have a measurable impact on your organization's productivity. But, how can you turn all that potential value from a fantasy into a reality? That's a difficult question!

Recent research continues to support the notion that people spend more time than you'd think looking for information. When they do find what they're looking for, it's often not as useful, relevant or correct as it could be. I've seen various surveys and studies suggest that people spend anywhere from 3.5 hours per week to 10 hours or more searching for information. I'm personally somewhat skeptical of those higher numbers, but even if it's only 10% of people's time, it's hard to argue that there is room for significant improvement.

So, how can SharePoint improve the experience and the results when workers go looking for information? There are two major ways, aside from the traditional 'folder navigation' approach: document classification and search. Search is fairly straightforward, at least in theory. It indexes the content (as well as properties) of documents and files, enables users to query for words or phrases, and returns a list of matching results, sorted by relevance. This can work well in some cases, but often requires some fine tuning and tweaking before it will return relevant hits for various search scenarios.

Document classification holds much promise. It allows very flexible tagging of content with properties or attributes (often called metadata) that can describe the origins, purpose and content of the documents in the repository. It can enable very fast and flexible browsing and navigating of documents, and can also be leveraged to improve search quality as well. The main challenge is that document classification requires a lot of effort, both to define an appropriate classification system for the business, and to actually assign or apply the correct classification data to each file in the repository.

What if you could have a robust, complete, pre-defined classification system for all of your content? What if you could customize and fine tune it for your particular business needs? What if it could automatically be applied to all of your documents, without the need for people to manually tag the files with metadata? You could potentially have the best of both worlds – easy and robust 'content find-ability', without investing a lot of effort to get it working.

That is exactly what the <a href="http://datafacet.com/" target="_blank">DataFacet</a> solution from WAND provides. DataFacet’s library of taxonomies can be installed in Sharepoint 2010's term store and the DataFacet taxonomy manager and auto-classification tools can be integrated so that a document added to SharePoint will be automatically tagged with the appropriate metadata from the taxonomies. Users can then browse content by navigating the taxonomy (or even multiple taxonomies) and search will be seamlessly improved as well.

Some of DataFacet's benefits for Sharepoint 2010 include:
<ul>
	<li>Access to a library of over 250 professionally built taxonomy domains</li>
	<li>Automatic tagging of documents as soon as they are checked in to SharePoint</li>
	<li>Intuitive taxonomy management capabilities to customize the taxonomy for your company</li>
	<li>Ensures your users can find the information they need, when they need it</li>
</ul>

		<title>Common CRM Mistakes and How You Can Avoid Making Them</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At SWC, we host monthly events focused on helping our customers choose the right <a title="Customer Relationship Management Solutions" href="/solutions/crm">Customer Relationship Managment</a> (CRM) system for their businesses. At these events, I get asked a lot of questions on CRM adoption, best practices and what are the biggest mistakes mid-market organizations make with CRM. Today, I thought I would share some common CRM mistakes and how you can avoid making them. I also encourage you to join me on Wednesday for my next CRM event (register below), where I will share more insights on keys to a successful CRM deployment from marketing to sales to customer service.
<h2>MISTAKE: Applying technology to an already broken process</h2>
Applying technology and automating an already broken process can be a very costly mistake for any organization deploying a new CRM solution. I suggest interviewing your top performers to understand their best practices. Understand how they go about their day – what works and doesn’t work for them. Also consider your customer’s perspective – how do they want to interact with you throughout the customer lifecycle? Define these processes and apply your CRM solution to match.
<h2>MISTAKE: Lack of an adoption plan – before, during and after launch</h2>
Too many CRM deployments fail as a result of a poor adoption plan. Most adoption plans only focus on the go-live date and a smattering of one-time training offerings. To increase the odds of widespread usage, companies need to have a sustained adoption plan in place before launch. Consider the deployment as if you were launching a new product to your customers. Weeks before launch, management needs to promote the business case for the new system and what are the expected longer-term results. At launch, offer training as usual, but ensure users are active in the system right away – create a ‘scavenger hunt’ of activities to perform right away. Training needs to continue on an ongoing basis for new hires.
<h2>MISTAKE: Continuing to use spreadsheets for reporting</h2>
Executive and manager-level staff need to be the frontrunners using the new <a title="CRM Solutions" href="/solutions/crm">CRM solution</a>. If they are active users and participants they are not only leading by example, but are also able to describe and quantify the business value of the platform. One way of showing the inherent value is to encourage the management of data all in one place. Sales managers need to fully embrace the CRM to pull forecast reports and other needed data. Typical disconnects for new deployments find sales managers asking for individual Excel sheets from each sales member that must then be aggregated. This double entry of information should be rendered obsolete with an effective CRM deployment.

		<title>Embracing the Windows 8 Change</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week I decided to upgrade my desktop from <a title="Microsoft Windows 7" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-7">Microsoft Windows 7</a> to <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Windows 8</a> and thought I would share my experience with everyone, since Windows 8 is a new product and I’ve heard that some may be skeptical about upgrading. As part of the process, I performed a fresh install into a VHD (Virtual Hard Drive), which allowed me to install Windows 8 on my desktop and still preserve my Windows 7 installation, just in case I wanted to go back. The end result was great and I have decided that I don’t ever want to go back! Here are some pointers to help make adopting Windows 8 much easier. Enjoy!
<h2>Do Not Be Scared of the Windows 8 User Interface</h2>
A lot of people are concerned about the Windows 8 User Interface (W8UI), but you only really see it when you press the start button. This hasn’t changed much in concept from the start menu. There was a lot of fuss over Windows 95 when it came out because it was different and 17 years later, people don’t want to get rid of the start menu. Don’t think of it that way; think of it as a start page instead. The start page is nothing more than a really big start menu with your installed applications, including the ones that are not optimized for the W8UI.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-6719 alignleft" title="Microsoft Windows 8 User Interface" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-windows-8-user-interface-300x171.png" alt="Microsoftstyle= Windows 8 User Interface" width="300" height="171" /><img class="wp-image-6717 alignleft" title="Microsoft Windows 8 Start Button On Desktop" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-windows-8-start-button-on-desktop.png" alt="Microsoft Windows 8 Start Button On Desktop" width="249" height="171" />
The best way to navigate the start page is to press the Windows button and then start typing what you’re looking for. This will bring up your applications that have those characters within the name, making it very easy to locate your applications faster. Get to know where the desktop button is on the start page. This will allow you to get into Desktop mode, which is what you’re used to. You have your icons on the desktop; you have your icons on the taskbar at the bottom, which includes some minor aesthetic changes. The start orb is gone from the taskbar, however you can still access it without pressing the Windows key on your keyboard, go to the bottom left corner and you will see a little picture of the W8UI come up, then click, it’s that simple!
You have a taskbar on every screen if you use multiple monitors; this is helpful when working on something in a different monitor, the ability to pull up all of your applications quickly. You can also click on the charms bar of each screen to bring up the clock on that screen, normally it is hidden by the Start page when it is up.
<h2>Everything Still Works the Same Way</h2>
I upgraded my desktop with a fresh install of Windows 8 Pro and installed every one of my applications without any issues including an old 2008 application probably written for Windows XP, if not older based on the dialog boxes. The application is for my Dymo 330 Turbo label printer which is old, but still works. I can use the old application, as expected in Windows 8.

<img class="size-full wp-image-6741 alignright" title="microsoft-windows-8-charms-clock-taskbar" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-windows-8-charms-clock-taskbar.png" alt="Microsoft Windows 8" width="361" height="226" />
<h2>Be Open to Change</h2>
As with anything new there will be some time to adjust. Embrace change and understand that the changes in Windows 8 were not made for the sake of change; Microsoft puts a lot of time and research into their interfaces and if you really try to learn the way things are done, the transition will be simple.
<h2>You Don’t Need a Microsoft Live Account…But</h2>
One thing you will notice with Windows 8 is that it is very mobile centric. With that comes the ability to use your Microsoft Live account to sync your settings to the cloud. This is nice, as you will have the same experience on any Windows 8 machine you log into. You are not required to have a Microsoft Live account to log into Windows 8; however you may not be able to use some of the applications that require it without one. and you will not be able to download applications from the Windows Store.
<h2>Apps in the Windows Store</h2>
This is probably my favorite part of Windows 8. Since it is mobile centric you now have access to the Windows Store which is the same store for Windows Mobile, which means you have access to the same cool and free applications, such as Cut the Rope, Fruit Ninja, as well as productivity apps. The best part is they are kept up-to-date, just like the phones on your mobile device, so no more going around and searching in different places for all the applications you need.
<h2>Some Quick Shortcuts with Windows 8</h2>
<img class="alignright" title="Microsoft Windows 8 Settings Shut Down" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-windows-8-settings-shut-down.png" alt="Microsoft Windows 8 Settings Shut Down" width="145" height="495" /><strong>Start Button</strong> – Opens up the Start page. When you are in a W8UI application there is not always a clear way to get back, so press the Start Button and it will bring you back. Remember that the W8UI was designed for tablets and smart phones, the behavior is similar.
<strong>ESC Button</strong> – This will either back you out of a W8UI application or close the Start page. When in doubt press the ESC button or the Start Button.

<strong>Start Typing</strong> – When you press the Start button or are in the Start page then just start typing whatever application or setting you want. The Start page will start showing you applications that match what you’re typing. If you want to choose a particular setting, there are classifications on the right side of the screen which allow you to choose what type you are looking for.

<strong>Right Click Still Works</strong> – When you are on the Start page you can right click on any of the tiles and instead of getting a popup context menu like you are used to. This gives you options on the bottom of the screen. You can also right click tiles without having to hold down the CTRL button, you will see a check mark on the tile showing you it is selected. The option at the bottom of the screen will apply to all the tiles you clicked on.

<strong>Desktop is Still There</strong> – Remember that the Desktop is still there and still functions the same way. There is a Desktop tile on bottom left of the screen to bring up the desktop. You will also go into Desktop mode if you open an application that is not designed for the W8UI. You can also open applications from the Desktop mode that you see on the Start page and if you are in Desktop mode then it will open up like a normal application, which may look different than if you opened it from the Start page.

The Four Corners – No matter where you are there is the ability to do different things with the four corners of your screen.
<ul>
	<li>The bottom left is the Start page</li>
	<li>The bottom right and top right is the Sidebar menu</li>
	<li>The top left will bring up other open applications</li>
</ul>
The Settings Menu – To get to the Settings menu pull up the Charms Bar, then click on Settings. This brings up options for the following:
<ul>
	<li>Network – Your network connections</li>
	<li>Sound – Volume</li>
	<li>Brightness – This is actually labeled “Unavailable” if you are on a desktop and can’t change your brightness.</li>
	<li>Notifications – Hide for one, three or eight hours</li>
	<li>Power – Sleep, Shut Down or Restart</li>
	<li>Keyboard – Brings up the software keyboard if you don’t have one physically connected</li>
</ul>
Logging Off – When on the Start page, click on your account icon on the top right and you will have options to Change Account Picture, Lock Your Computer or Sign Out (Log off).
<img class="alignleft" title="Microsoft Windows 8 Sign Out" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-windows-8-sign-out-300x206.png" alt="Microsoft Windows 8 Sign Out" width="300" height="206" />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
I’ll admit I was very skeptical at first about <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Microsoft Windows 8</a> and the new interface. But, now I am glad I was forced to use the new interface with Server 2012, which mimics the Start page. I embraced the change and haven’t looked back. Once you get comfortable with the new interface you’ll notice that you can do things more quickly. Worst case scenario, you can install Windows 8 into a VHD and not overwrite your existing Windows 7 or XP installation to play with Windows 8 on your hardware. There are many great posts out there on how to do this. If you aren’t 100% sold on the W8UI, then do a search for “Windows 8 Classic Shell” and you can install an application that emulates the old Start menu. I don’t recommend this as you are delaying the inevitable, do you still run Peachtree in DOS? I didn’t think so, you’ll eventually come around.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone is talking about the consumerization of <a title="IT Consultants" href="http://www.swc.com">IT</a> or the tendency for new information technology to emerge first in the consumer market and then spread into business organizations. There are many business benefits to the consumerization of IT, as employees continue to BYOD and use their own consumer devices at work, whether it’s smartphones, tablets, their own laptops, or the Cloud. Let’s start with the business benefits of the Cloud. It requires (a lot) less capital to develop, distribute and market software over the Cloud than the prior traditional models. This has led to massive innovation and a significantly broader set of solutions for the business end user. The Cloud provides the ability for software and solution developers to incrementally and rapidly enhance their software and applications based on immediate “online/community” feedback. The result is a solution that rapidly improves in performance. Prior models required users to wait until “the next release” of a product, which was inefficient and slowed down business productivity.

Perhaps, the most integral part of business productivity is the users. Through the consumerization of IT, users have the ability to pick the tools they need to be the most productive. They are no longer hampered by what IT gives them or have to rely on a long, drawn out enterprise selection processes. Consumerization leads users to a greater adoption of IT, which leads to greater communication, collaboration and productivity. This ensures the business runs more efficiently. Today, part of this story is the new Modern Office experience brought to us by the Microsoft Surface tablet and <a title="Microsoft Windows 8" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Windows 8</a>. Now all of your users can access all of their business applications (<a title="Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm">CRM</a>, Office, <a title="Microsoft SharePoint" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a>, <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL</a>, etc.) anytime, anyway synced with all of their devices through Sky Drive in the Cloud, on a tablet. This is dramatically changing the way we work. We are more productive and connected than ever before (for better or worse), as our device (our work) is with us all the time.

		<title>Is Virtualization right for you?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>First Things First, What is Virtualization?</h2>
Virtualization in a general term means abstracting the physical resources from the services and pooling them together so they can be utilized more efficiently. Server virtualization is when you take a physical host and install a hypervisor on it. The hypervisor is what communicates directly with the hardware of the host server. The hypervisor then presents virtual hardware to the virtual machine when it is powered on. The virtual machine then has an operating system installed within it, such as <a title="Microsoft Windows" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</a> or Linux. When you install the operating system within the virtual machine it does not know that it is running on virtual hardware (there are some hardware drivers that get installed to work better with the virtual hardware, these are provided by the manufacturer of the hypervisor). The hypervisor takes care of scheduling all of the virtual machines’ virtual hardware and processing the operations on the physical hardware.

Now that we have that out of the way, the first thing to think about when looking at virtualization is: Do I plan on buying new hardware? The reason this should be the first question is because there is no need to spend money on virtualization unless you are planning on buying at least one new server. Even though <a title="Virtualization Technology" href="/solutions/virtualization">virtualization technologies</a> can be installed on older hardware I wouldn’t recommend it for two reasons:
<ol>
	<li>You lose out on the advancements made in hardware technology that makes virtualization more efficient;</li>
	<li>Unless you have servers that are sitting idle most of the time you won’t be able to take advantage of the consolidation ratios seen on newer hardware.</li>
</ol>
Don’t think that you need to virtualize all your servers at once, unless you have all old servers and you are looking to do a hardware refresh on everything. Virtualization is a great technology that will grow with you. Start off with virtualizing low hanging fruit like print servers or domain controllers. Yes, it is safe to virtualize domain controllers, and you should always have at least two domain controllers. Once you get those servers virtualized then look at what else can be virtualized, maybe a lonely little application that few people use.

One of the greatest things about virtualization other than the consolidation benefits is that you can P2V your servers. P2V means “Physical to Virtual” where you copy your physical server into a virtual machine using certain tools. What this means is that you can take your server that was living inside a box all by itself and put it inside a virtual machine where it lives alongside other servers sharing the resources of a single physical server. The application and operating system inside the virtual machine has no idea that it is virtual. This has benefits including – “nothing has changed” according to your users. They still access the services of that server the same way they always had.

Once you have your servers virtualized you can realize the great benefits of virtualization including the mobility of your virtual machines. Yes, I said mobility, as in moving your servers around. Since the hardware inside the virtual machine is “virtual” and presented to the operating system by the hypervisor, that means your virtual machine can move to any host running the same hypervisor and physical CPU generation without needing to be shut down (the details of the CPU requirement goes beyond the scope of this post). This is called migrating your virtual machine. Migrating means that you can literally move your virtual machine from HostA to HostB without any interruption of service from the virtual machine.

Once you virtualize your servers you will start to see the benefits surrounding virtualization. Now think about what you could do if you were to virtualize your network, or your storage. This is already being done…I’ll post about it at a later date.
Now you are saying “Which hypervisor do I need?” There are multiple vendors for virtualization including Microsoft (<a title="Microsoft Hyper-V" href="/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v">Hyper-V</a>), <a title="VMware Consulting" href="/solutions/virtualization/vmware">VMware</a> (vSphere), <a title="Citrix Consulting" href="/solutions/virtualization/citrix-xenapp">Citrix</a> (XenServer) and then some others, these are the top three. Deciding which one is a tough choice and shouldn’t be taken likely, as once you make a choice it takes some work to move to another one. Things you should take into account are the management offerings of each, the cost of implementing and the growth potential. They all will work on the newer hardware, not necessarily the “newest” as they need to be updated to support the newest technologies.

Once you have fully embraced virtualization as a plan to move forward with all new server builds you need to understand that virtual is different than physical. Although you can manage your virtual servers like physical servers that doesn’t mean that you should. You will lose out on the benefits of virtualization if you do this. There are products out there that work specifically with virtualization and I encourage you to look into them. A couple of management things in particular are backups and anti-virus. Backup and AV solutions that are designed specifically for virtualization, understand that virtualization is different from physical servers. The reason I bring these two technologies up is because they can be resource intensive on a single server which gets amplified when performing them in a virtual server. Virtual servers are sharing the resources of a single host. If you start doing a backup or an AV scan on all your virtual servers at the same time you have all your virtual servers contending for the same disk IO and CPU cycles at the same time. Backup and AV vendors that are built for virtualization go about doing this in a different way.

Backup and AV vendors don’t need to be installed within the virtual server to perform the functions that it needs. This is because the hypervisor has ways for these technologies to do their job at within the hypervisor intelligently. This means that you can back up all your virtual servers without affecting the performance of your virtual server or scan for viruses at the hypervisor as it gets written to disk. Since all the data IO and CPU instructions and memory passes through the hypervisor then the AV software can watch it there instead of inside the virtual server. Same goes for backup software; since the virtual hard drives of the virtual server is stored as a file on a drive somewhere, the hypervisor can direct the backup software directly to that location instead of having to go through the virtual server. This goes the same for replication; you can now replicate your virtual servers much more easily than ever before.

Server virtualization is a new way of thinking; understand that and you will gain more out of it. It is part of the Software-Defined-Data-Center. Remember I mentioned virtualizing your storage and networking, you can also virtualize your security and desktops and applications. This is what the Software-Defined-Data-Center means, virtualizing your data center for mobility, agility and resiliency.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many businesses have deployed a <a title="Customer Relationship Management Solution" href="/solutions/crm">Custom Relationship Management</a> or CRM System. At SWC, we host events focused on helping our customers choose the right CRM system for their businesses. Our expertise is in <a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM" href="/solutions/crm">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a> and <a title="Salesforce.com CRM" href="/solutions/crm">Salesforce.com</a>. We know that customers drive your business and choosing the right CRM system can profoundly affect an organization’s profitability and growth. Once you choose a CRM system, there are many ways to customize your solution so that it can effectively manage the customer lifecycle, from marketing to sales to service. This blog will focus on some of the best practices for utilizing your CRM system for marketing automation. In this case, we will define marketing automation as using customer analytics and marketing modules to help drive attendance to webinars, training, and offline events. To learn more about this topic, please read my latest <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Web-Exclusives/Viewpoints/Webinars-Luncheons-and-Open-Houses-86244.aspx" target="_blank">article</a> in Destination CRM or join me for my next event.

When using your CRM to drive attendance to events, defining your target audience and market should be your first priority. That will determine how you build out your database. Your database of accounts and contacts is critical to your success. Take a very pragmatic approach to building it out. CRM is the house for accounts and contacts, but you must also define appropriate attributes to accounts and contacts to ensure your messages reach the right audience. Your CRM solution should allow you to configure account and contact records – creating custom fields to attribute and categorize these records. However, avoid over doing it with custom fields. The definitions of these attributes must hold legitimacy over time.

Now that you know your target audience and can identify them in your CRM system, you can create messages for specific audiences. Is there a pain point your audience faces that you wish to address? Are you offering a new service for the industry they serve? Your message should be crafted in a way that is appealing and resonates well with your target audience. Once you have crafted the perfect message, you need the means to create and deliver that message. Most CRM solutions focus on delivering the foundational tools for managing marketing, sales and service. Advanced functionality such as marketing automation tools can be plugged into your CRM to create highly visual and compelling campaigns. Combining your CRM with a marketing automation tool allows you to segment your audiences and send different messages for different audiences – even if the intended end result is the same. For instance, if I want to drive attendance to a CRM event, I could create three different messages – one for marketing leaders, one for sales leaders and one for service leaders. The end result is to drive them all to attend the event. However, each message is a little different, and tailored to peak their interest and compel them to act – or register and attend my event. SWC uses SalesFusion, but several other tools are out there to meet your needs, Marketo is another popular tool to connect with Salesforce.com.

There are many additional CRM functionality features that can be employed to derive even more value from your CRM investment. For example, workflows can be created to notify your sales reps if their contact registers for an event, thus prompting a follow up sales call. Notifications can also be created when opportunities are created from events. Integrated dialers can be customized for outbound lead generation teams. This is another “delivery mechanism” for attacking your target audiences. With a few simple clicks, your inside sales team can quickly call upon your target audiences with your targeted messages.

The final component of the marketing automation message is reporting and analytics. Basic reporting has improved in most CRM tools to allow you to track campaign spend, opportunities created and revenue generated. With this data, the marketing team can now calculate the ROI of their campaigns. They now know what works and what needs to be improved – tracking the effectiveness of the database (contact lists), messages and overall campaign. Even more powerful reporting can be enabled by combining CRM data with other external sources, like creating a cube in a <a title="Business Intelligence Tools" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a> (BI) tool.

		<title>Designing Your SharePoint Architecture</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/designing-your-sharepoint-architecture</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the more common questions I encounter in conversations about <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Consulting" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> is, "How do I go about designing the right architecture for my SharePoint environment?" Most people seem to understand that this is an important question to ask (and answer) when initially deploying the product, or when planning to expand and enhance an existing implementation. Failing to consider architecture design won't necessarily doom a SharePoint project to failure, but it certainly will have a significant negative impact on its chances of long-term success.

My usual response to the question is, "When you say 'architecture', what do you mean?" In the context of SharePoint, there are several kinds of 'architecture' to consider:
<h2>Physical Architecture</h2>
This refers to the hardware and software platform that runs SharePoint and related services. It can include web, application and database servers (physical or virtual), operating systems, applications software (SharePoint, <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL Server</a>, etc.), networks, load balancers, firewalls, security appliances, and more. It also can refer to components or environments that are hosted “in the cloud,” by Microsoft or other hosting providers.
<h2>Logical Architecture</h2>
SharePoint provides a hierarchy of structured containers, each of which offers different capabilities, configurations and intended uses. The hierarchy includes Farms, Servers, Services, Web Applications, Site Collections, Sites, Lists/Libraries, Folders and Items. The SharePoint environment is ultimately crafted from these building blocks.
<h2>Functional Architecture</h2>
Of the architecture types, this is the only one that is user-facing. It includes definitions of all of the business scenarios and user experiences to be provided by the SharePoint solution, for all participating audiences. “Publishing Company Information,” “Department Document Management,” and “Executive Dashboards” are all good starting points, but a good functional architecture design will get deep enough into the details of the why, what, how and who to ensure that all business goals are met.

It would seem that each of the above areas might be straightforward in simple scenarios, but could also be quite complex in larger implementations. How do you go about determining where your deployment will fall on the “architecture complexity scale?” How can you address the initial question and actually define the “right architecture” for your SharePoint environment? The answer lies in approaching the various aspects of architecture in the right order.

At the beginning, it is important to define the “Solution Vision” for the organization’s usage of the technology. Ideally, this process will include key decision makers – the higher up, the better. The initial objective should include answering the following types of questions:
<ul>
	<li>Why is the organization deploying SharePoint – and how is it intended to benefit the business? Be specific!</li>
	<li>Who are the target audiences for the solution?</li>
	<li>Which individuals should participate in defining solution requirements, approving designs and ultimately owning responsibility for managing the solution? Hint: It's not IT!</li>
</ul>
A clear, shared understanding of the business goals will make most of the subsequent decisions easier. From there, you can begin to define the functional requirements for each audience of business users, including such things as:
<ul>
	<li>Information publishing and consumption scenarios</li>
	<li>Group/team document sharing, collaboration and workflow needs</li>
	<li>The types of content to be managed, along with their lifecycle considerations and retrieval scenarios</li>
	<li>Accountability and access control requirements (aka security permissions structure)</li>
</ul>
An experienced <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Solution" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint Solution Architect</a> will be able to analyze the answers to these questions and develop a logical structure that will best support the defined functional needs. One of the main challenges is to maximize the intuitiveness and ease-of-use for business users, while minimizing the effort required to manage and maintain the environment. Skipping these steps or tackling them out of order is how many SharePoint deployments begin their descent into either apathy or chaos.

Once the functional and logical architectures have been determined, you will have the data required to design the physical architecture for your implementation. There are a number additional things to consider, including where to host the environment, which edition of SharePoint is best for your needs, how many users you have, and what your budget will accommodate.

Of course, once you have figured all that out, you've only completed the first couple of steps on a long path to the SharePoint promised land….

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I can’t believe 2012 is almost over! It has been a great year for SWC and we are quickly getting ready for 2013. Around this time, I always find myself reflecting on the year and making some New Year’s resolutions. You know the ones – vow to work out more, eat healthy, spend less money – all lofty, but rarely kept. Many of the <a title="IT Business Services" href="http://www.swc.com">IT business</a> leaders I’ve talked to lately are also making their 2013 New Year’s resolutions, or are at least setting goals and creating 2013 business plans. I thought I would share some of the most common 2013 IT New Year’s resolutions I’ve heard so far:
<ul>
	<li>This year, I want to ensure our IT systems are never down – 100% uptime!</li>
	<li>This year, I want to keep our systems monitored and managed – 24X7!</li>
	<li>This year, we will make sure our users are getting the support they need – day or night!</li>
	<li>This year, we will make sure our users have the tools they need to help them succeed!</li>
	<li>This year, our company will proactively plan for technology investments and eliminate the unpleasant and expensive surprises!</li>
	<li>This year, our IT Department will win the Team of the Year Award!</li>
	<li>This year, our <a title="IT Careers" href="/careers">IT team</a> members will be able to take vacations to exotic islands where there is no cell service or internet access – and relax!</li>
	<li>This year, IT will implement the cool technologies that will make our company more efficient, more productive, and more competitive!</li>
</ul>
Wouldn’t these resolutions be great, they all sound great! But, the reality is we all get busy and sometimes our resolutions get placed on the backburner or forgotten. In order to really accomplish your goals and keep your resolutions, you need support. Someone to keep you motivated and make sure you are on track. That’s where SWC Managed Services comes in. With SWC, you get a technology team that works for your business and helps you keep your IT New Year’s resolutions. Together, we help deliver a more productive, efficient and strategic IT department for your company. By combining forces, processes and technology with your company, SWC will help you improve your bottom line with cost-effective measures such as:

		<title>The Top Five Signs You Need A Managed Services Partner Or Are Ready To Outsource</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In SWC’s 2012 Technology Trends Survey, we asked over 200 mid-market IT professionals and business leaders, “What is the greatest challenge in IT today?” and received an overwhelming response of “Keeping Up!” This response doesn’t really surprise me, as many of the IT professionals and business leaders I meet with every day express the same concern. Technology is moving too fast and IT is growing more complex and increasingly difficult to implement, manage and maintain. So how do you get ahead and achieve your business goals if you are a one-person department or are constantly putting out IT fires? It’s tough to talk strategy when your time and resources are limited. Our survey suggests <a title="Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services">Managed Services</a> may be the answer, as one third of our respondents said they were partnered with a <a title="Managed IT Services Solutions" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">managed services provider</a> to help monitor and manage their IT environments.

So, what are the top five signs you need Managed Services or are ready to outsource?

Some possible signs are:
<ul>
	<li>IT problems keep piling up and there’s no end in sight</li>
	<li>The IT team doesn’t have the depth and breadth of knowledge to design, implement and support IT solutions</li>
	<li>IT is viewed as a problem instead of a solution – or – IT is a necessary evil and not an enabler for the business – or – IT is not viewed as strategic to the company</li>
	<li>Budgets are increasing every year, but the perceived ROI of IT is low</li>
	<li>There are no strategic IT plans, no defined direction</li>
</ul>
The last three bullets always make me sad to think about. IT should enhance an organization, not hinder it. At SWC, our Managed Services offering is more than just a solution to “Keeping Up,” it’s a strategic partnership, where we’re constantly listening to our client’s business goals and then working together to create a technical environment necessary to support them. It's a technical vision and structure for their business that makes the most of their IT investment. We implement industry best practices to ensure high performance and complement their internal team with dedicated support, so they become more productive and efficient. It’s so more than just “Keeping Up,” we are helping our clients find success through Managed Services.

		<title>Five Principles Of Successful Web Design</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-design-services/five-principles-successful-website-design</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SWC’s <a title="Digital Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">Digital Design</a> group’s philosophy on design is simple: design should be used to achieve a purpose, not just design for design’s sake. We take that point of view very seriously and apply it to every design project we engage in. In the end a website should be more than just pretty, it should communicate a message, clarify uncertainties and elicit a response.

We’ve put together a list of five principles that can be used to improve any website.
<h2>Branding</h2>
Your brand is probably one of your business’ most important assets. How you appear to potential customers and how your current clients perceive your brand can be one of the most important determining factors for future growth. Does your current website convey to visitors that you are a business they can trust, or does it make you look like a fly-by -night operation? If your website doesn’t clearly and effectively convey your brand position you might be losing business without even knowing it.

If you aren’t sold on the importance of branding take a look at the <a href="http://www.interbrand.com/en/best-global-brands/2012/Best-Global-Brands-2012-Brand-View.aspx" target="_blank">Intrabrand Best Global Brands of 2012</a> rankings. Brands that are ranked highly on the list consistently outperform their competitors and have laid the foundation for consistent growth year after year.
<h2>Design for Usability</h2>
What is usability? Simply put, usability represents the ease of use of a website or software application. Can current and new customers find what they are looking for quickly on your site? Can they easily consume that information without needing to jump through hoops?

This has taken on a whole new level of importance with the emergence of mobile web browsing. Overall the projections are perfectly clear and predictable: the desktop PC monitor is steadily losing its dominance as tablets, phones and other mobile devices experience continued growth in sales.
<h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
What good is a website without visitors? A good <a title="SEO Strategy" href="/solutions/digital-design/search-engine-optimization/website-performance-benchmarking">SEO strategy</a> brings traffic to your site and should be part of your site’s functional design strategy.

Sites that rely on heavy use of Flash and images to convey content simply aren’t understood well by Google and other search engines. Your website should use plenty of copy, well organized html tags (Alt, Title, and H1) and demonstrate a clear hierarchy of content to search engines, as demonstrated with a well-designed sitemap. Successful SEO design balances the use of visual design and SEO content to achieve a site that looks great and performs well in the search engines.
<h2>Strive for Clean, Purpose Driven Design</h2>
Well organized content helps visitors to find exactly what they are looking for and enables site owners to guide visitors toward content they want without overwhelming them. Well-designed sites make good use of white space, include call to actions, and are designed to funnel visitors in a content flow. Sites that make use of clean design principles convey a sense of organization and reliability that reflects directly on how visitors may view your business. A couple of good examples include the new Microsoft.com site, <a href="http://www.googleventures.com/" target="_blank">Google Ventures</a> and hopefully our SWC Technology Partners site!
<h2>Creative Visual Design</h2>
Finally, we can get to the fun stuff – that layer of artistic design that we in the industry call visual design. After all of the previous considerations have been put into action, it’s time to make your site stand out from the crowd and create a lasting impression. This is the final coat of polish that brings the whole site together, immediately draws visitors in and positively influences their first impression of your company.

Understanding the principles of successful web design can help to ensure that your next web project will be a successful endeavor. By following our five principles, you can save time, boost traffic and improve the performance of your website.

Thin client and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) models demonstrate how we as IT leaders adopt to new technology. New technologies must meet the changing market and users’ needs in a rapid and secure way. As a result of the consumerization of IT, users now want their software, hardware and applications to be accessible from multiple locations, and to be compatible across other systems and personal devices. Because of these and other considerations, organizations need to consider if thin client and BYOD models will meet their organization’s needs.
<h2>The Advantages of Thin Client</h2>
There are numerous advantages to the thin client model which include lower operational costs, better security and higher reliability. The lack of software being installed on devices will not only lower operational costs, but it will also reduce the amount of time it takes to update, troubleshoot and manage your thin client environment. Thin Clients also provide a smaller surface area for security threats. Should a user become infected with a virus, we can simply have them log off and log back in. They will be logged into a new and healthy virtual desktop. Further, if a device is stolen there would be no loss of data, since there is no data on the device. Finally, due to the smaller hardware footprint and sometimes no moving parts, the lifespan of a thin client is five to seven years compared to a normal three year life span.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As many of you may be aware, although <a title="Microsoft Exchange Solutions" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Exchange 2013</a> has been available for months, migrating from Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010 is not yet supported. Well, I am excited to announce that Microsoft has now released updates to allow us the ability to migrate from Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010. This means that all organizations running Exchange 2010 can now upgrade to Exchange 2010 SP3, and those running Exchange 2007 can move to Exchange 2007 SP3 RU10. But, don't click that 2013 setup icon just yet, as the 2013 side will not be ready until Exchange 2013 CU1 is released sometime this quarter. One final note, there is no direct upgrade path for those still running Exchange 2003, a hop to Exchange 2010 will be required.

If you'd like assistance with planning your path and preparing for your migration, please feel free to reach out to us.

		<title>Signs It’s Time To Move On From Your Managed Services Provider</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At SWC our <a title="Managed Services Solutions" href="/solutions/managed-services">managed services</a> offering continues to evolve, as there is constant pressure for midmarket companies to keep up. Recently, we have expanded our offering to include enhanced managed services, including remote services such as <a title="Managed Services Help Desk" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-help-desk-service-desk-services">help desk</a> and production support; onsite support; specialized services such as virtual CIO, <a title="Virtual Database Administrator VDBA" href="/solutions/managed-services/virtual-dba">virtual database administration</a>, and Microsoft Exchange, Lync, and <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/microsoft-sharepoint-managed-services">SharePoint managed services</a>. We are very excited about our enhanced managed services offering and the level of support we are providing to our customers.

Over the years, we’ve realized that many of our current managed services customers have chosen SWC because they were unhappy with their previous provider and didn’t realize they could get so much more out of their IT investment. I wanted to share some feedback about why these customers have chosen SWC and some signs it’s time to move on from your managed services provider.
<ul>
	<li>They’re Too Reactive: They say they’re proactive, but I only hear from them when a problem occurs.</li>
	<li>They’re Too Small: They had one guy that knew my IT environment, but he left. Now I’m a training ground for their engineers.</li>
	<li>They Aren’t Strategic: I feel like there’s no strategic planning – I have to ask for insights and recommendations.</li>
	<li>They Don’t Think Outside the Box: They only recommend solutions that they know, and not necessarily what I need for my business.</li>
	<li>They Just Don’t Get It: I feel like we’re a small fish in a big pond – they can’t relate to my business.</li>
	<li>They Don’t Even Know My Name: I don’t feel like I have a relationship with my provider. They meet with me when I ask and it’s usually a different person every other month.</li>
	<li>They’re Out the Door a 5 PM: They don’t provide the coverage I need – they’re only available during business hours – but my operation is 24x7.</li>
	<li>They Issue Too Many Tickets: They have to engage managed services for every support ticket – which causes delays and money. They don’t even have Level 2 or Level 3 support.</li>
	<li>They Aren’t Subject Matter Experts: They don’t know my business and applications, only hardware and network. If I have an issue with SQL, I’m stuck. There are no enhanced managed services. I need a subject matter expert across all of the technologies in my environment.</li>
	<li>They’re Constantly Billing Me: I have a managed services contract with fixed fees, but they nickel and dime me for support – I usually pay twice the charges.</li>
	<li>I’m Not Even Sure What They’re Doing: They don’t even give me a monthly report!</li>
</ul>
At <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a> SWC, we offer a service that is proactive, with consistent coverage and guaranteed SLAs. Our customers get a dedicated technical team focused on continuous improvements, proactively creating an IT strategy and technical roadmap for their business. We ensure the application of best practices and deliver increased network uptime in a reliable, stable and secure environment. Its flexible and guaranteed support coverage with predictable IT support costs. At SWC, we are helping our clients make the most of their IT investment and succeed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As more and more firms move towards <a title="Microsoft Lync Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/microsoft-lync-managed-services">Microsoft Lync</a>, especially as a VoIP solution, we're asked repeatedly about its high availability and disaster recovery abilities. I thought I'd take some time to discuss some of the new functionality included with Lync 2013 at a high level.

Let's start with high availability. For an organization that typically wants to withstand a single server outage, Lync has the ability to add redundant servers to just about any role (three is the minimum recommended for the Front End role). These servers should be load balanced with a combination of DNS load balancing and hardware load balancing depending on the role and services offered. Lync 2010 had this capability to an extent as well; however the exciting part is that the back end SQL databases now support synchronous mirroring. With <a title="Microsoft Lync 2010 Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2010">Microsoft Lync 2010</a>, SQL failover clustering using shared disks between servers was really the only way to protect yourself against the failure of a database server, however this comes with its own set of complexities and wasn't always an optimal solution. <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013 Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Lync 2013</a> supports SQL mirroring out of the box and in fact does the majority of the configuration work for you right from within Lync! The amount of storage you'll need is duplicated, similar to what you would expect with an Exchange DAG, however it's often a much more cost effective and easier to manage solution.

So what if that's more than you need? Perhaps your recovery time objective (RTO) allows for a few more minutes and the cost of the additional resources can’t be justified. What if you primary concern is simply disaster recovery and failing over to another site? Lync 2013 has introduced the concept of pool pairing. Pool pairing gives you real time synchronization of the databases across servers or sites. In the event of a failure of a pool, be it a single standard edition server experiencing a hardware failure or the whole site is down due to a power outage, the administrator can invoke a failover command to allow users to come back up on the remote site with nearly full functionality. This process generally happens over a period of minutes once started depending on the size of the implementation. Once failed over to this site, users can continue to operate as normal receiving inbound calls and outbound calls provided the PSTN trunks are configured for failover as well.

If there are any additional items you'd like to see discussed in our <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications" href="/blog/tag/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communication</a> blogs, whether it be feature level or with technical depth, please reach out to us, we'd like to hear from you.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SWC’s launched its first live web show, <a title="Beers With Brad" href="/bwb">Beers with Brad</a> on Friday, March 1st. This interactive show gives viewers the chance to tweet in all of their IT questions and have them answered live on the show by Brad and his guests. Beers with Brad airs every other Friday during happy hour at SWC and explores the particulars of hops and barley, while discussing <a title="Microsoft System Center 2012 Consulting" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center 2012</a> in addition to various technical topics introduced by viewers, Brad and his guests.

<a title="Microsoft System Center 2012 - SWC IT Consulting" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BRc7aTqeBJg?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/beers-with-brad-swc.jpg" alt="Wach Beers With Brad" width="500" height="281" /></a>

During the show, Brad Ellison and his first guest Roger Adamson, Beer and Spirits Specialist from <a href="http://www.binnys.com/" target="_blank">Binny’s Beverage Depot</a> in Willowbrook, discussed beer and answered various questions from the audience. The two beers Roger sampled on the show were the Long Strange Triple and The Sixth Glass, both from Boulevard Brewing Co. Brad loves to rate every beer on the show and gave the Long Strange Triple an 8 out of 10 and The Sixth Glass a 9 out of 10. There were also many questions tweeted in about beer by our viewers, one in particular was, “What is the best beer for St. Patrick’s Day?” According to Roger, the best beer for St. Patrick’s Day is Guinness or Conway’s Irish Ale.

After the beer talk, Brad and his second guest Jeremy Alt, <a title="IT Consultant" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consultant</a> at SWC, discussed Microsoft System Center and <a title="Virtualization Consulting Services" href="/solutions/virtualization">Virtualization</a> for the technical portion of the show. Jeremy provided a wealth of knowledge on this topic and told viewers how virtualization can help companies cut costs. According to Brad and Jeremy, Microsoft System Center’s ability to manage IT environments with Virtual Machine Manager and Application Controller provides a compelling reason for companies to move into the virtual IT landscape. Many viewers tweeted in their technical questions live on the show, some of the ones Brad and Jeremy answered included: “What are the challenges of Virtualization?” “Does virtualization require a SAN?” and “What is the best way to back up your virtual machine?”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Videos have become an essential form of marketing and brand awareness for many companies due to their ability to showcase products and convey messages in a highly effective manner. At SWC, our <a title="Video Production Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">video production services</a> offer the ability to create custom videos catered to your company’s needs.

Our video production team would like to highlight a video we recently created for Directions Training. Directions Training has been successfully educating IT and business professionals worldwide since 1991. Directions Training offers expert training and certifications for all major technology vendors, including Microsoft, Adobe, Cisco, Citrix, Oracle, CompTIA, Project Management and more. Directions challenged SWC to create a unique video that would not only engage viewers, but also educate potential clients about their new service offering of Virtual Instructor Led Training, <a title="Direct2You Virtual Instructor IT Training" href="http://www.directionstraining.com/Pages/Direct2YouTrainingSolution.aspx?=swcblog" target="_blank">Direct2You</a> (D2Y).

After listening to what Directions wanted and understanding the projects goals, SWC took a creative approach of using a combination of custom animation, catchy sound and informative, yet humorous copy to develop and deliver a video that explained a complicated concept in a fun and easy way.

The outcome was a video that has not only improved sales for Directions Training, but has also given them the ability to market their Direct2You virtual training solution in an effective manner.

		<title>Basic Scanning Versus Advanced Capture For SharePoint</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/basic-scanning-versus-advanced-capture-sharepoint</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s no secret that <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Consulting" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> is a comprehensive platform for content management, team collaboration, process automation and a whole lot more. There is a lot of media focus on all the things you can do with SharePoint, and how to go about accomplishing those things. But, there are still a couple of areas where SharePoint lacks certain capabilities. Of course, another factor in the success of the product is the rich 'ecosystem' that has grown up around SharePoint. Microsoft partners have stepped up to fill the void in those key areas, by adding functionality that integrates with and extends SharePoint's native features.

One such area is the conversion of paper documents to a digital format. This is generally referred to as 'document scanning,' though there are several terms that mean (almost) the same thing. While it's true that Microsoft Office has a rudimentary ability to scan documents and even perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images to convert them to text, it isn't well-suited for much more than a single document at a time. There are also a large number of 'scan to PDF' programs available in the marketplace, most are inexpensive, or even included with scanners and multi-function devices with scanning capabilities. Most of them do a good job of taking the output of a scanning device and saving it in a digital format that can be archived in an electronic file repository like SharePoint. These are often referred to as 'basic scanning solutions.'

But what if you have to process more than a few documents at a time? What if you have a large collection of paper archives that you want to migrate into your powerful new SharePoint document libraries? Scanning documents one-at-a-time, saving them to SharePoint manually and indexing (or tagging) them individually can become a time-consuming (and therefore expensive) proposition.

Enter 'Advanced Capture with Automatic Data Extraction' solutions. Products that fall into this category offer far more than basic scanning capabilities. Such solutions can process the basic scanned image and apply OCR to turn the image into searchable text, but that's only the beginning. From there, the best products of this type can interpret the image, apply rules-based search-and-replace and data lookup functions, and actually extract relevant data from the image. This information can be used to intelligently determine where each individual document starts and ends, when a stack of paper is scanned. Such solutions can figure out what the document is and where to put it in the repository, based on the extracted data. It can even assign index attributes (aka metadata) to each document as is it loaded into the appropriate SharePoint site/library/folder, automatically. Add to that the ability to interpret bar codes, marks such as checked boxes and 'scan-tron' bubbles and even handwriting recognition, and you have a powerful way to process large numbers of pages with little to no human intervention required.

SWC has had the opportunity to work with 'advanced capture solutions' from several vendors. Some can be quite expensive, but they also add far more than capture capabilities to SharePoint's base functionality. We have found that the PSI:Capture suite of products from <a href="http://www.psigen.com" target="_blank">PSIGEN Software</a> offers industry-leading advanced capture capabilities, for a price that is very attractive to SWC's typical mid-market customers. PSI:Capture is focused exclusively on providing a 'swiss army knife' of document scanning and capture features and functionality, for a fraction of the price of its competitors.

		<title>The End of Threat Management Gateway from a Unified Communications Perspective</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year's announcement that Forefront Threat Management Gateway (TMG) was being retired along with most of the Forefront line caught a lot of us by surprise. We had heard it was coming but weren't quite sure if we wanted to believe it. As you know, TMGs have been the recommended way to publish <a title="Microsoft Exchange Lync Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Exchange and Lync</a> servers to the Internet for quite some time. With the TMG having such broad and diverse abilities, an optimal replacement wasn't immediately apparent. Microsoft Unified Access Gateway (UAG) has most of the features of TMG and many more, but isn't fully supported for some Lync functionality yet and is overkill if used for only this purpose. For those running hardware load balancers, some of these duties can be handed off directly to that hardware, but for those running smaller or simpler deployments, there is a solution that has recently been recommended and may make more sense. That solution is Application Request Routing (ARR) for Internet Information Services (IIS), which can handle many of the basics that were formerly handled by a TMG implementation. Load balancing, URL rewrites, and basic reverse proxy are all in there and it has recently gained a level of acceptance as a possible replacement within the <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications Consultants" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications</a> community. For those with TMG already, we still recommend using it to its full potential as mainstream support for the product does not end until 2015, with extended support only ending in 2020.

For more information on the use of ARR with Lync, check out the following link from TechNet: <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/nexthop/archive/2013/02/19/using-iis-arr-as-a-reverse-proxy-for-lync-server-2013.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.technet.com/b/nexthop/archive/2013/02/19/using-iis-arr-as-a-reverse-proxy-for-lync-server-2013.aspx</a>

During this live show, our host Brad Ellison and his guests discussed beer and had a throw down between the Microsoft Surface Tablet and Apple iPad. Beers with Brad is a live technical happy hour that airs on select Fridays at 4 PM. This interactive show explores various technologies while viewers tweet in all of their questions and have them answered live on the show by expert <a title="IT Consultants" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consultants</a>!

Watch this week’s episode of Beers with Brad to hear the answers and learn more about the Microsoft Surface Tablet and Apple iPad.

<a title="Microsoft System Center 2012 - SWC IT Consulting" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bB7SHzE-unE?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/beers-with-brad-swc.jpg" alt="Wach Beers With Brad" width="500" height="281" /></a>

This week, Roger Adamson, Beers and Spirits Specialist from Binny’s Beverage Depot in Willowbrook, was back to discuss Beers with Brad. To get us all ready for St. Patrick’s Day, he brought three festive beers to be sampled by Brad on the show, they were Magnums Hard Cider, Firestone Walker Double Barrel Ale and Victory HopDevil Indian Pale Ale. Brad then rated the beers, giving Magnums Hard Cider a 7.5 out of 10, Firestone Walker Double Barrel Ale a 9 out of 10 and Victory HopDevil an 8 out of 10.

For the technology portion of the show, Brad and his guests, SWC consultants – Elliott Baretz, Jeff Lanham, Mark Johnson and Noah Mattern, discussed the Microsoft Surface Tablet and the Apple iPad. The guests provided viewpoints from each side comparing both the pros and cons of each device. The Microsoft Surface Tablet earned two points for the integration of Microsoft products and great business use. The Apple iPad earned four points and proved to be the best tablet for its ease of use, popularity and use outside the office. Viewers tweeted in their questions live on the show, some that were answered included: “Which tablet are your clients using more often, the Surface or iPad?” and “Which tablet gives you the better bang for your buck?”

SWC’s Elliott Baretz and Jeff Lanham talk about <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/microsoft-sharepoint-managed-services">Microsoft SharePoint</a>. SWC has been working with SharePoint since the inception of the product over ten years ago. SharePoint has come a long way since then, as there have been multiple iterations and versions of the product since 2001. <a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013 " href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint 2013</a> is better than ever and SWC has seen a lot of positive reaction and adoption to Microsoft’s newest release. Still, with a robust product like SharePoint the possibilities are endless; it can do so much that it’s hard for clients to know where to begin. SWC has put together a proven methodology, through the SWC SharePoint Way to assist our customers in deploying the right SharePoint solution for their business needs.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-8254" title="IT Consultants SWC SharePoint Way" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/it-consultants-swc-sharepoint-way-300x187.png" alt="IT Consultants SWC Sarepoint Way" width="300" height="187" />

The SWC SharePoint Way recognizes that there are many advantages to SharePoint, but there are also an equal amount of pitfalls, if you don’t know what you are doing when you deploy the product. Through our many years of experience, SWC has recognized that there is a prism that clients need to apply to the many different aspects of a SharePoint deployment in order to get the best return on investment, whether it’s the architecture, how it’s put together or the end user training. The SWC SharePoint Way focuses on three major areas:
<ul>
	<li>Understanding Needs: How do we help identify what the client’s needs are and ensure that the SharePoint solution we deliver is truly what the client wants and will help them from a business perspective</li>
	<li>Solution Design: Using a proven approach and methodology to structure the implementation of SharePoint</li>
	<li>Delivering the Promise: At the end of the day how do you manage it, keep it healthy and ensure that everything that needs to happen happens, so you continue get the most value out of the solution in the long run</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A guest blog by Jeff Carlson, <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications Engineer" href="/careers/chicago-microsoft-lync-unified-communications-engineer-job">Microsoft Unified Communications Engineer</a>.

As noted in a previous post, <a title="Microsoft Exchange 2013 Launch" href="/blog/microsoft-exchange/closer-exchange-2013">We’re One Step Closer to Exchange 2013</a> by my colleague Anthony Caragol, those of us in the <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications</a> world have had a lot of excitement around finally being able to migrate users to Exchange 2013. The updates, <a title="Microsoft Exchange Solutions" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2010">Exchange 2010</a> SP3 and Exchange 2007 SP3 RU10, that would finally give us the ability to migrate earlier environments were released in February 2013. However, we were still missing one important piece of the puzzle. That final piece is Exchange 2013 CU1, which was originally slated to be released the first quarter of 2013. We have learned that this has been delayed due to issues with Exchange 2010 coexistence in Microsoft’s final test pass of the product. In an article on TechNet, Ross Smith, the Principal Program Manager for Exchange Customer Experience, briefly states that there were issues with Exchange 2010 coexistence along with the reasoning behind the delay of the update.

This means, we will unfortunately have to wait a little bit longer for the update to Exchange 2013, which is now tentatively April 2nd 2013.

If you’d like assistance planning your path and preparing for your migration, please feel free to reach out to us.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is in continuation of last week's "<a title="SWC Microsoft SharePoint Way" href="/blog/sharepoint/the-swc-sharepoint-way">The SWC SharePoint Way</a>" post.
<h2>Understanding Needs</h2>
In the beginning of a <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Projects" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint project</a>, there is always that first stage, we call it envisioning, but it’s really defining what the solution is going to do. SWC does this in a unique way based on our <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/microsoft-sharepoint-managed-services">SharePoint experience</a>; it begins with knowing what kinds of questions to ask and knowing what kinds of problems SharePoint can help solve for an organization. It’s also about helping clients understand what’s possible and what SharePoint can do to help their business. Some firms go through a checklist of all of SharePoint’s features and capabilities in their environing process and then ask clients to pick which items they want, but if you are not living and breathing SharePoint every day, you might not fully understand the solution in its entirety, or what each of the items are and how they can help your business.

SWC’s focuses on a visual approach to SharePoint. We surface best-in-class designs and solutions in an interactive way through our envisioning process, so our clients can see how the solution works and what others have done and how the platform manifests itself into a productive tool. Then we go through a number of visual iterations to define a solution that is really going to work for them through a wireframe process or concept design process. That way we have surfaced up the skinning of a solution that everyone can agree on from the top down, that we can work towards making a functional reality.

The next part of the SWC SharePoint Way involves all of the components of SharePoint and the solution design. Since SharePoint has so many tools in the tool chest, how do you understand which one is the right one for your business needs and challenges. SWC brings all of our years of experience and hundreds of implementations to the table to guide our clients and help them understand what is the right way and most effective way to use SharePoint to solve their business problems.
<h2>Solution Design</h2>
SWC recognizes that it’s not always about how SharePoint looks; it’s also about how it performs. Our senior developers meet with clients throughout the envisioning process and provide guidance on functionality. As part of each solution design, SWC leverages our Intellectual Property and proven methodology to build a custom SharePoint solution tailored to their unique business needs.
<h2>Delivering the Promise</h2>
The third aspect is user adoption and acceptance. SWC learned a long time ago that design is a crucial part of adoption and obviously we’re focused on that, but we have also invested in training and user adoption programs that are fairly progressive to assist our clients. SharePoint has a lot of capabilities, but it’s really a platform and not a turnkey solution, so you have to build it into what you need it to be. SharePoint can be that agent for change in a business environment, but in order to get the most out of it, people need to understand how to use it and govern it. Helping users understand the solution within the context of their own environment in a training program is critical to adoption. It all comes down to change management and understanding from a business perspective how SharePoint will help users do what they need to do more effectively. SWC has learned that you can drive a lot of adoption if you have an attractive engaging environment that is solving business needs and helping users become more productive.

The final step is the SharePoint knowledge transfer. SWC ensures our clients are in tune to what we are doing throughout the build and deployment, so that they can pick up the reigns and move the SharePoint project forward. In fact, the promise of SharePoint is to empower people to do a lot more and not have to rely on IT to do certain things. Its SWC’s responsibility as we leverage our experience to help clients implement SharePoint successfully to also support them and transfer that knowledge. Ultimately, we want them to own the project, mange the solution and get the most out of it in the long run.

		<title>Responsive Web Design: A Unified Cross Platform Experience</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-design-services/responsive-web-design</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year represented the first year that desktop PC sales actually shrunk since 2001, meanwhile tablets and mobile phone sales are increasing month after month and will continue to grow for the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/31/whoa-tablet-shipments-now-more-than-half-that-of-the-pc/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">foreseeable future</a>. If your current website is optimized for desktop sized monitors you can assume that your web traffic will be decreasing as mobile users turn to more mobile friendly competitors for web content. Building a <a title="Responsive Website Design" href="/solutions/digital-design">responsive website</a> can fix this issue by making your website viewable on any device and allowing your site visitors to have a more unified experience regardless of whether they’re using a desktop, smartphone or tablet. In simple terms a responsive website uses a new browser technology called "media queries" to detect a user's screen resolution and creates a layout for them "on the fly" to best fit their screen size.

Understanding some of the more practical benefits of responsive website design can help you to better understand the value proposition and see why forward looking companies like Microsoft, Sony, Disney and Google have already adopted this new technology:

<img class="size-medium wp-image-8361 alignright" title="responsive-web-design" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/responsive-web-design-300x253.png" alt="Responsive Web Design Example" width="300" height="253" />

<strong><a title="Chicago SEO Services" href="/solutions/digital-design/search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a> -</strong> Having a single website for desktops, tablets and mobile devices increases the value of each page's SEO score. Instead of spreading valuable page ranking scores to duplicate websites, Google prefers you create a single canonical URL for each page of your site.

<strong>Save Marketing Dollars -</strong> <a title="Mobile App Development" href="/swc-mobile-app">Developing mobile apps</a> is expensive, and if you want to cover all three markets (Apple, Android and Windows) that cost is going to be even higher. Beyond that, updating new content on your main website in addition to your apps adds another layer of complexity that will turn into more dollars spent and slower turn-around times.

<strong>Increase Conversions -</strong> No matter what business category you are in your website should be geared towards actively converting visitors into clients whether that is direct sales through ecommerce or generating qualified leads. According to Google 61% of mobile users will move on to a competitor's site if they encounter a frustrating browsing experience. (See http://googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2012/09/mobile-friendly-sites-turn-visitors.html)

<strong>Future Friendly -</strong> It's nearly impossible to predict what the landscape will look like in years to come, but we can assume with certainty that users will be visiting websites from multiple devices. With mobile phones with browsers, smart TV's and appliances and even more unexpected technologies like <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/" target="_blank">Google Glass</a>, building a responsive website will help to ensure that your site will provide a more user friendly experience from any device, even ones that have not yet been released.

		<title>Lync 2013 Keeps Your Voice Mails Home</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We continue to be impressed by the new features and functionally of <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013 Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync 2013</a>. Keeping your voice mails home is another one of those features that doesn’t disappoint. If you’re a fan of Lync's simultaneous ring or call forwarding features (I use it all the time), you may have had messages delivered on your cell phone's voice mail if it was off or without signal. That's because your provider's voice mail system picks up immediately instead of ringing to your phone, so Lync just does its job and passes the call along. This creates an inconsistency in the Unified Messaging solution and can be frustrating, especially when you’re on vacation or overseas and other places where you rely mostly on e-mail for real-time communications.

Lync Server 2013 has an enhancement that practically eliminates these situations, detecting when your provider's voice mail picks up instead of you and has the voice mail delivered to your Inbox instead. It is called Voice Mail Escape. The way it works is quite simple: if the forwarded call gets picked up immediately (or way too quickly), Lync assumes your provider’s voice mail picked it up and stops attempting to reach your cell. Lync then keeps ringing your desk and eventually goes to your Exchange Unified Messaging voice mail. Better yet, this feature can be enabled or disabled on a per-user or per-site basis, giving you the flexibility to exclude users who may be incredibly quick on the answer button, or just don't mind their messages going to their cell phones at all.

Here's the quick <a href=" http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj688157.aspx" target="_blank">link</a> on how to configure Voice Mail Escape on your Lync 2013 infrastructure.

		<title>Two Fundamental Approaches to Microsoft SharePoint</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the ten years that I've been working with <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a>, I've had easily over a thousand conversations with organizations that are either considering deploying the product or have already done so. In SWC's SharePoint luncheon events, I always ask the question, "Who in the room has SharePoint deployed in some fashion within your organization?" Lately, almost everyone is raising their hands. When I ask the follow-up question, "Who would consider the rollout an unqualified success?" almost all of the hands go down. Why do you suppose that is?

I believe there are two basic approaches to deploying SharePoint. The first and by far the most common could be termed the “bottom-up” method. You could also call it a “departmental,” “grassroots,” “stealth” or even “if you build it they will come” deployment model. It usually entails repurposing an old, unused server, or perhaps creating a new virtual machine on a virtual server host. Someone (probably, but not necessarily from IT) does a “quick and dirty” installation of <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/microsoft-sharepoint-managed-services">Microsoft SharePoint</a> Foundation, which generally doesn't require any additional licensing investment (or corresponding approval from management or accounting). A default SharePoint web application and site collection are created, and people merrily start using it…or not. They create some sites, add some content, and upload some documents – lather, rinse, repeat. It's quick; it's easy, and best of all its cheap. It starts providing value almost immediately. If people want to use it – great! There are no obstacles. If people don't want to use it, that's fine, too. No harm, no foul.

So, what's wrong with that? Well, at first, nothing. The trouble begins once adoption and usage starts to ramp up. As more people make new sites, add more content and upload more documents, the environment begins to get cluttered and disorganized. It gets harder to figure out where to put things, and harder to find the things people have put there. Overlapping (or outright duplicated) sites, content and documents get strewn all over the place. There is no organization, so navigating and browsing the content gets more challenging. Permissions get modified and overridden in an effort to implement some access control. Without a defined process and structure, the permissions configuration quickly gets hard to understand, let alone manage. And what about those poor souls who decided they didn't want to use SharePoint, once the content and documents they need to get their work done have moved there? And what about all the potentially business-critical information that now lives in a SharePoint environment that isn't properly managed, secured or backed-up?

The alternative to the “bottom-up” approach is, of course, a more “top-down” approach. It entails a little planning and design effort, prior to actually putting a server up. It requires that you decide what you want to use SharePoint for and what business value you expect to get out of it. You have to identify the stakeholders, engage with them in defining the creative, functional and technical requirements, and then design a SharePoint architecture that will meet those requirements. Once you've built the “right” solution, you have to engage those stakeholders to help manage the environment over time, and of course you have to enable them to do so effectively. It’s easier said than done, no doubt.

What's the benefit of the “top-down” approach? Well, I believe it’s the only consistently effective antidote to the pitfalls and perils of the “bottom-up” approach. It's the only reliable way to get the most business value out of SharePoint. It doesn't necessarily require that you scrap your existing implementation and start over, but it does mean that you have to take a step back, reevaluate your collaboration and information management strategy and actually tackle the (often hard) questions and decisions about the future of SharePoint in your organization.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As part of SWC’s <a title="Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services">managed services offering</a>, we provide <a title="Virtual Database Administrator Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/virtual-dba">virtual database administration</a> (VDBA) services. We have found that the majority of the midmarket organizations we serve have <a title="SQL Server Services" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL databases</a>, but don’t always have a fulltime SQL database administrator on staff dedicated to maintaining them. This can lead to network performance problems, backup issues and slow running applications. SWC provides VDBA services to help these organizations optimize SQL performance and improve the reliability of their environment.

I thought it might be interesting to share the following blog on ‘a day in the life of a VDBA’ at SWC to further explain what our VDBAs do on a daily basis to ensure that our customer’s environments are optimally performing.
<ol>
	<li>Get a cup of hot coffee!</li>
	<li>Open and review email from clients and the Managed Services team regarding SQL Server issues requiring our support</li>
	<li>Check Network Operating Center (NOC) dashboard for thresholds that have been breached (failures and warnings) for VDBA clients. NOC team sends alerts and emails on issues with SQL Servers to the client and the VDBA team.</li>
	<li>Review job success\failure emails from overnight VDBA maintenance jobs. Failure jobs are reviewed daily, investigating the reason of failure and resolving and researching any remaining issues. Failure is documented in a report for the team. Any issues needing client approval are entered into a ticket and contact is made with the client to discuss resolution.</li>
	<li>Perform a quick review of client SQL Server systems in order to head off any potential problems in regard to capacity or performance. Trends regarding disk capacity and memory usage can be reviewed over the last 90 days to help identify potential pain points. This is done weekly.</li>
	<li>Software team had performance issues on a client system overnight. Meet to discuss the issue and research possible cause. Map out a strategy to monitor, and discuss ongoing performance enhancements.</li>
	<li>Assist a <a title="Software Developer Job Chicago" href="/careers/chicago-application-software-developer-job">developer</a> in finding the best way to test data compression.</li>
	<li>Test a cool new script to see if it would solve ongoing space issues.</li>
	<li>Find a known bug in client’s SQL 2000 server causing a job to fail. Build a workaround solution to allow job to succeed, but reminded customer again that we need a plan for migration off of SQL2000!</li>
	<li>Help a Managed Services client with space issues and failing backup jobs. Build a script to perform after business hours process to restore space back to the system and reduce the footprint of the database. Backup, shrink, backup, and rebuild indexes after hours.</li>
	<li>Take a break to grab some candy from the receptionist’s desk.</li>
	<li>Work with engineering lead on a client’s SQL server to open appropriate firewalls to allow replication between two systems.</li>
	<li>Work with <a title="Engagement Manager Job Chicago" href="/careers/chicago-business-engagement-manager-job">Engagement Manager</a> and Account lead on a client’s request for SQL support; develop strategy to meet their needs.</li>
	<li>Assist Account lead with a client SQL system having performance issues. This could be due to poor application or database performance. Perform very quick high level review of system to identify potential performance issues and offer ideas on resolutions. Often poor performance is a result of inadequate database or query design, with things like missing keys or indexes on tables or improper join construction on queries being the usual cause.</li>
	<li>Notified of free lunch in the kitchen, so sprint to the kitchen to enjoy pizza with co-workers!</li>
	<li>Respond to client request for after business hours SQL work. Contact client and discuss details and best time to perform task. Notify NOC team of potential outage after hours.</li>
	<li>Create documentation for build of a new SQL Server instance for VDBA client. Include best practices to follow in any SQL Server installation considering server function, scope and client preference.</li>
	<li>Work on client’s monthly VDBA report.</li>
	<li>Throughout the day, we check that there are no new alerts emails that need attention.</li>
	<li>Go home and spend time with family and relax, knowing SWC’s managed services team has my client’s covered!</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="/swc-technology-partners/about-swc">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC’s live web show Beers with Brad aired Friday, April 12th at <a href="http://www.binnys.com" target="_blank">Binny’s Beverage Depot</a> South Loop store in Chicago! Beers with Brad is a technical happy hour streaming live on select Fridays at 4PM (CST). This interactive show gives viewers the ability to tweet in questions about various technologies and get them answered on the show! On Friday’s Beers with Brad, Brad Ellison and his guests discussed Big Data. Watch this week’s episode of Beers with Brad to learn more about the privacy vs. convenience of Big Data.

<a title="Microsoft System Center 2012 - SWC IT Consulting" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/j9tOdoZmoSM?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-beers-with-brad-041213-big-data.jpg" alt="Watch Beers With Brad Big Data" width="500" height="281" /></a>

Roger Adamson, Beer and Spirits Specialist at Binny’s Beverage Depot in Willowbrook, joined Brad for another show! The three beers Roger sampled on the show were the Dortmunder Gold and Rye of Tiger from Great Lakes Brewing Company and Weihenstephaner Hefe Weiss Dunkel from Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan all the way in Germany. According to Roger, the Dortmunder Gold is a great beer to drink anytime since its light and has a very moderate hop level. If you like hops, Rye of the Tiger is the beer for you. Roger stated, “If you love hops and being adventurous, you will love this beer.” Finally, the Weihenstephaner Hefe Weiss Dunkel is a great beer to pair with a burger and any dinner time meal.

After the beer talk, Brad and his guests discussed the topic of Big Data while many tweeted in their questions. Joining Brad for this topic was Jeremy Alt, <a title="IT Consultants" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consultant</a> at SWC, Katie Mowery, Account Manager and Digital Marketing Specialist at Tech Image and Suzie Saxman, attorney at Seyfarth Shaw LLP. Brad and his guests discussed the various levels of Big Data and how it can impact many. Suzie explained that the information we release on social media sites is public access, so we need to be aware of the information we post. Katie described how Big Data helps marketers and consumers and many people need to be more aware of what they are “opting into.” Viewers tweeted in their questions during the show, some that were answered included: “What data should you never divulge online?” “What are the benefits of Big Data?” and “Are companies able to take all of our information?”

Please join us for our next <a title="SWC's Beers With Brad Event Registration" href="/bwb/">Beers with Brad</a> on Friday, April 26th a 4PM (CST)! Don’t forget to tweet <a title="SWC Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/SWCTechPartners" target="_blank">@SWCTechPartners</a> all of your IT questions for Brad and his guests to answer live on the show!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[User mobility has taken root in contemporary culture and affected the way billions of people work and communicate. Central to the mobility movement is the need or desire to improve efficiency, and create opportunity for dynamic moments to occur. Modern business tools such as email and conferencing services have played key roles in transitioning to an extended or mobile office world. Next generation tools such as <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync 2013</a> can transform a PC, tablet or smartphone into a comprehensive communication device that extends the corporate experience to any location, with VOIP, Video Conferencing, Persistent Chartrooms and Instant Messaging.

With simplified Lync Meetings, users from multiple locations can collaborate in real time with audio and video. They also have the ability to upload PowerPoint presentations to share as well as other documents, and can chat either one on one or with the group.

These technologies have also been extended to mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. Lync 2013 Mobile Clients are now available for iOS, Android, and Windows 8 platforms. In 2013, joining conferences from mobile devices is an easy, smooth and intuitive experience. Perhaps the most anticipated feature of the Lync 2013 Mobile Client has been the ability to make VOIP and video calls from you device with either a Wi-Fi or cellular signal. <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications</a> platform has created a mobile office world of endless possibilities!

Andrew Gluck stays true to his Chicago roots, is a loyal Cubs fan and continually pursues the Chicago startup scene. “There is great energy here in Chicago,” said Andrew. “Chicago is becoming a hub (for startups) and I’m excited to be part of that.” With 1871 and an emerging startup community full of active venture capitalists, Chicago is a great location to launch a new business.

“We have the right team in place and we are excited for what’s ahead,” said Andrew. The Ox&amp;Pen team includes many young and ambitious individuals who believe in the company and are focused on its success. Part of their business strategy includes recognizing their team’s strengths and outsourcing tasks that can get in the way. The Ox&amp;Pen team currently consists of determined sales professionals and social media experts, but they outsource their information technology, for web design and application development to maintain their prestigious look and feel. The mobile application is now on its 9th version, continually being updated and improved since its launch in April 2012.

		<title>The Importance Of Solution Design In A SharePoint Deployment</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/importance-of-solution-design-microsoft-sharepoint-deployment</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the things I'm often asked to do is help clients understand what <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> is all about and then assist them in envisioning what it will do to bring value to their organizations and solve their business challenges. I usually say that Microsoft SharePoint is a big product with a lot of features and capabilities. But the question isn't “Can SharePoint do X?” it’s always “Of all the many ways SharePoint can do X, which way is the best way to do it for my business?”

It's generally not hard to figure out at least the high-level business requirements for the most common SharePoint value areas. I typically characterize them as: the company intranet, the document repository and the group collaboration environment. Most organizations can benefit from a solution that enables users to understand what's going on now, quickly and easily find needed information, and manage group collaboration around conversations and content. All of those things add up to enhanced productivity, for anyone that can even loosely be described as an “information worker.” When you get a little more specific about these things, you arguably have "defined your business requirements."

So, if defining business requirements isn't challenging, then why are there so many SharePoint implementations out there that fail to meet those business requirements? And, why do so many SharePoint projects end up taking longer than expected, going over budget and ultimately not accomplishing the project's objectives?

I have a theory that it's due to two main things: lack of appropriate design effort during implementation and lack of governance during operations. I have previously published several blog articles on the topic of <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Governance" href="/blog/sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-governance-areas">governance in SharePoint</a>, so I won't go down that rabbit hole again here. But, I do want to dig a little deeper into why I think solution design (or more specifically, functional design) is critical to a successful SharePoint deployment.

SharePoint is a platform, not a turnkey solution. In order for it to do what you need it to do, you have to build it out. You have to create a site structure that makes sense for your business and is also easy to manage and extend. You have to craft a home page that's both engaging and useful to everyone. You have to decide how to organize your document repository initially, migrate your content into it and manage its inevitable growth. Finally, you have to figure out what groups need to collaborate about what, and which tools will help them do that without getting in the way. These are all challenges of functional design.

Defining requirements isn't enough to ensure a successful SharePoint deployment. In fact, it isn't even enough to determine how much time and effort (and therefore money) it will take to build and implement the right SharePoint solution. Effort can vary dramatically for different approaches to seemingly straightforward requirements. Without defining how the requirements will be met via SharePoint capabilities, or getting buy-in from all the relevant stakeholders that your SharePoint solution design will actually meet the requirements and accomplish the business objectives, your odds of a happy outcome drop significantly. You don't have to invest a ton of effort on design – a little can go a long way. But ignore it entirely, and your results will suffer. I promise.
<h2>Here are some examples of good SharePoint design, that are engaging and increase user adoption.</h2>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Another <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">SWC</a> episode of Beers with Brad aired on Friday, April 26th at Binny’s Beverage Depot South Loop store in Chicago. Beers with Brad is a live web show airing on select Fridays at 4 p.m. (CST). Watch this episode to join in the discussion of technology, security and privacy. Is technology invading our privacy? Tune in to find out!

<a title="SWC's Beers With Brad Technology And Security" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Zg1lGBnU3rM?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/BWB-Pic-Security-Technology.jpg" alt="Watch Beers With Brad Technology, Security and Privacy" width="500" height="281" /></a>

Roger Adamson, Beer and Spirits Specialist at <a href="http://www.binnys.com/" target="_blank">Binny’s Beverage Depot</a> in Willowbrook joined us for another episode. Roger brought along three beers that were sampled on the show. They were the Big Daddy IPA and the Prohibition Ale both from San Francisco Speakeasy Ales and Lagers and the Sculpin IPA from Ballast Point Brewing Company. Roger recommended pairing an IPA with a salad or seafood and the Prohibition Ale with barbeque or ribs. Speakeasy Brewing Company will be hitting the shelves this week at all Binny’s locations and Ballast Point Brewing Company will be hosting a party at Binny’s South Loop location on May 8th from 5-8 p.m. to celebrate.

Todd Wickens, Engagement Manager for <a title="Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm">CRM Solutions</a> at SWC and Sarah Knight, Associate at Seyfarth Shaw LLP, joined Brad Ellison on this past week’s episode to discuss technology and security following recent events related to the explosion at the Boston Marathon. One topic discussed was New York City’s partnership with Microsoft to create a camera system that alarms and notifies authorities of bags that are unattended and criminals that are in the city through facial recognition software. Chicago has also installed a similar technology system within trains and heavily populated areas. Many believe that these cameras are invading privacy, while others hold opposing views. Watch this episode of Beers with Brad to determine if technology is keeping us safe or invading our privacy.

Join us for our next <a title="SWC's Beers With Brad Event Registration" href="/bwb/">Beers with Brad</a> on Friday, May 10th at 4 p.m. (CST). Remember to tweet all your IT questions to <a title="SWC Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/SWCTechPartners" target="_blank">@SWCTechPartners</a> to get them answered live on the show.

On this week’s show, Silicon City host <a title="SWC VP Elliott Baretz" href="/swc-technology-partners/leadership/elliott-baretz">Elliott Baretz</a>, Vice President of Marketing and Business Development at SWC, Erica Bethe Levin and Jessica Zweig sit down to discuss all things cheeky in Chicago. Based out of 1871, a great startup hub inside of the Merchandise Mart, Cheeky Chicago has become one of the most talked about startups in the city. Not only do they have an immense following through their online lifestyle magazine, but also through their various events and royalty reward program.

Erica and Jessica are experts and lovers of all things Chicago. Cheeky Chicago was created after they both realized a need for a “city centric female focused guide for Chicago,” said Erica. “We basically solved our own problem,” added Jessica. Cheeky is a “brand that speaks to the cosmopolitan woman and endorses a philosophy to the community that they should be a little cheekier to each other meaning more open hearted, friendlier and warmer. Cheeky aims to create a likeminded community of 24-40 year old girls who are really down to earth, like to live a fun fabulous life and feel a little VIP at times,” said Jessica.

Since their launch in 2008, Cheeky has been focused on building their market in Chicago and expanding to many other cities. They currently have 50,000 readers, 25,000 subscribers and 2,000 Cheeky card holders. In efforts to build their market they will be releasing a mobile application in the next six months for their Cheeky royalty card program. To stay up to date on all things Cheeky Chicago head over to <a href="http://cheekychicago.com/" target="_blank">Cheeky Chicago</a> and subscribe to their online magazine.

		<title>Implementing Workflows in Microsoft SharePoint</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/implementing-workflows-microsoft-sharepoint</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Of the many ways that <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Solution" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> can help people work together more effectively, “workflow” is one of the most elusive real-world scenarios. While the concept of “automating and streamlining repetitive business processes” promises compelling improvements in productivity and manageability, it is rare (in my experience) to find organizations that have successfully implemented workflow solutions in a meaningful way. More often, people plan to implement workflows later in the process, usually during the “run” phase of the typical “crawl - walk – run” approach. The problem is that they never manage to get there.

It doesn't have to be that way. While it's true that complex business processes can be challenging to automate, <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Way" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint/swc-sharepoint-way">Microsoft SharePoint</a> provides a variety of features and capabilities that can be leveraged to improve collaborative processes without necessarily requiring a lot of effort. In fact, SharePoint Server editions include several useful “out-of-the-box” workflows that you can start using with very little effort. They can facilitate easier and more robust document routing for review and approval, among other things. Even better, they can be accessed right inside the Office applications – you can tell SharePoint to circulate your document to one or more individuals automatically, without even leaving Microsoft Word!

If you wish to take a step beyond the default workflows that Microsoft provides, you have several options. In <a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-2013">Microsoft SharePoint 2013</a>, Microsoft Visio and SharePoint Designer work together to enable business analysts to design, build and deploy simple to moderately complex workflows, without any need for programming. You can graphically lay out the flowchart of your process using Visio 2013's SharePoint Workflow stencils, import your flowchart into SharePoint Designer and from there deploy the “workflow template” to your SharePoint environment. Each time someone needs to manage an example of that business process, they can create a new workflow instance based on the template you defined.

There are, of course, some limitations to the types of workflow templates you can create in Visio and SharePoint Designer. While the 2013 versions do add some new activities and looping capabilities, you still can't create “state machine” workflows. That means that more complex business logic flows will still need to be programmed in Visual Studio and will require the skillset of an experienced SharePoint developer. The good news is that those developers can leverage the full power of the Windows Workflow Foundation engine to do just about anything imaginable.

One final option that can be worth considering is third-party vendors that offer commercial add-ons for SharePoint. There are many options available, but the one I've personally heard the most good things about are the products from Nintex (www.nintex.com). They offer a workflow design environment that is conceptually similar to the Microsoft Visio + SharePoint Designer approach, but includes additional capabilities and enhanced features that reduce the need to develop custom workflow activities and solutions in code.

Regardless of how you approach workflow solutions in SharePoint, there can be a lot of value in leveraging its capabilities to improve your processes. Let your work flow!

		<title>Microsoft Exchange, An Enterprise Ready Voicemail Solution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications</a> and Unified Messaging are phrases tossed around a lot these days and knowing just who’s offering what can be very confusing. Today, I wanted to talk to you about Microsoft Exchange’s Unified Messaging, an enterprise-ready back end voicemail solution that can work with almost any vendor, whether it’s Cisco, Avaya, Mitel, ShoreTel, or <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a>. Here are three compelling reasons why you should throw out your old voicemail solution and switch to Microsoft Exchange.
<h2>Cost</h2>
There’s a good chance you already have an investment Microsoft Exchange on premises or in the cloud. Adding voicemail capabilities isn’t far away and can provide you with significant savings over paying your existing provider for continued maintenance and upgrades.
<h2>Features</h2>
While Exchange has all the standard features you’d expect from a voicemail platform, such as automated attendants, speech recognition and lighting the message waiting lamp on your desk phone, there are many features you might not know about. In Microsoft Outlook Web App users can easily configure custom greetings for different callers and voicemails can appear as emails complete with a speech-to-text translation, making them easily searchable. You can give certain callers the option to hit a number and be transferred to your cell phone or any other programmed number. For example, a specific company listed in your contacts folder may get the option to call your cell phone, so you’re not playing phone tag. Any old voicemail solution lets you call in to listen to your voicemails, but with <a title="Microsoft Exchange 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Microsoft Exchange</a> you can call in and listen to not only your voicemail, but also your email on a long drive and even make modifications to your calendar using voice commands.
<h2>Management</h2>
All of these features come in a package that’s familiar to your IT team. Most firms don’t have dedicated phone staff, or if they do, they don’t fully understand the complexities of the systems and rely on outside contractors when it gets difficult. Microsoft Exchange is an easy to manage, trusted and resilient system that your IT staff and employees are already familiar with.

Microsoft Exchange has a lot to offer, no other system integrates more easily or seamlessly with the Office stack than Microsoft. From easy to use advanced features, to simplification of management and a quick return on your investments, why waste your time and money on an outdated voicemail and phone system?

Contact SWC today to talk about how Unified Messaging can help you meet your business objectives, or if you’d like assistance with planning your path and preparing for your Microsoft Exchange migration. To learn more about <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC’s Microsoft Exchange offering, please join us for our next <a title="Unified Communications Event" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications event</a> or follow Anthony Caragol on LinkedIn.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Salesforce.com Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm/salesforce-com-customer-relationship-management">Salesforce.com</a> is the world’s number one <a title="Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm">Customer Relationship Management system</a>, providing a comprehensive solution for sales force automation, customer service, partner management, and marketing and campaign management. When Detroit-based digital engagement agency ePrize deployed Salesforce.com to their organization, executives realized that the adoption of the new CRM platform was going to be a challenge. The company turned to <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC Technology Partners, to build Compete, the number one Salesforce gamification app, and in the process successfully created a new company called LevelEleven.

<a title="IT Consultants SWC And LevelEleven Salesforce.com Application" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eBSCVHyFwEM?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Level-Eleven.jpg" alt="SWC Salesforce.com Customer Relationship Management LevelEleven" width="474" height="262" /></a>

ePrize is a digital engagement agency specialized in motivating consumer behavior for over 250 of the top 500 brands in America. They were using Salesforce.com as a sales and Customer Relationship Management solution and were looking for a tool to increase adoption and reward salespeople for using the product. Managers tried running sales contests for behaviors like making the most calls, booking the most meetings and converting leads – all to be tracked by Salesforce, but could not find an application available to do so within the platform’s existing functionality. ePrize responded by developing their own solution and hired SWC to build it.

The project became so successful that it took on a life of its own and ePrize decided to spin it out and create its own company, called LevelEleven. LevelEleven is now focused on building software used by sales organization and call centers to keep salespeople focused on the right things, by taking the data in a company’s CRM system and using it to motivate their sales force. The app was originally launched at Dreamforce 2011, received a lot of positive feedback and has since been sold to many prominent customers. Today, Compete is the number one gamification app in the Salesforce App Exchange.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Beers with Brad was live again on Friday, May 10! The show introduced a new format which features CIOs discussing their careers, ventures, and the exciting technology projects they are working on. This gives viewers the unique opportunity to view a day in the life of a CIO and learn more about innovative <a title="Technology Solutions" href="/swc-technology-partners/about-swc">technology solutions</a> that are having the greatest impact on midmarket businesses. Watch this week’s episode featuring Vito Trifiletti, CIO of Preferred Meal Systems.

<a title="SWC's Beers With Brad Technology And Security" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MXhvgcZT2os?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-beers-with-brad-cio-tech-talk.jpg" alt="Watch Beers With Brad Technology, Security and Privacy" width="500" height="281" /></a>

Roger Adamson, Beer and Spirits Specialist at <a href="http://www.binnys.com/" target="_blank">Binny’s Beverage Depot</a> in Willowbrook was back to discuss beer with Brad Ellison, Consultant and Engagement Manager at <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC and Vito Trifiletti, CIO at Preferred Meal Systems. Roger sampled two beers on this show, the Bottom Up Wit from Revolution Brewing Company and the Domaine Dupage from Two Brothers Brewing Company. The Bottom Up Wit is brewed with orange peels and coriander, a brewing spice, and pairs well with warmer weather since it is a great thirst quencher. Two Brothers Brewing Company started out as a home brew shop until it became quite popular and decided to launch as a company. The Domaine Dupage is great to have at dinner and paired with a more “fancy” meal.

After the beer discussion, Brad and Vito had the opportunity to discuss what it’s like to be the CIO at Preferred Meal Systems and all of the new technologies they are implementing. Preferred Meal Systems is a leading provider of meal solutions for more than 40 years, with clients ranging from schools to airlines and senior living facilities. As CIO, Vito is the company’s technology leader and gets to works with every business function from sales to marketing to supply chain, logistics and finance completing both operational tasks and strategic technology projects as well. He frequently meets with senior executives to help work through the business challenges they are facing and help them use technology to improve their operations, standardize processes and set up workflows. The company also does a lot of work with the Microsoft stack, particularly <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Consulting" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a>, <a title="Microsoft CRM Consulting" href="/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a> and <a title="Microsoft Exchange Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Microsoft Exchange</a> to help drive business results.

Some of the game changing technologies Preferred Meals Systems is implementing for their customers include a new online menu system. SWC Technology Partners digital design and software solutions teams are currently completing this project, which will give parents the ability to check their child’s lunch menu and its nutritional values while on the go, using their mobile devices. The company also uses numerous technologies daily to keep all of their products organized and maintained, such as voice directed warehousing. This innovative solution allows warehouse workers to wear a headset, so their hands are free while a computer talks helping them sort, maintain and find cases. Watch this week’s episode of Beers with Brad or head over to <a href="http://www.preferredmealsystems.com" target="_blank">PreferredMealySystems.com</a> to hear more about this technology and many others that Vito and his team have been working on.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC Technology Partners premieres another exciting episode of Silicon City featuring TransitChatter. Silicon City is a bi-weekly web show focusing on the Chicago startup community. Previously, Silicon City has featured <a title="Chicago Ox&amp;Pen" href="/blog/silicon-city/swc-tv-announces-silicon-city">Ox&amp;Pen</a>, <a title="Cheeky Chicago" href="/blog/events/swc-tv-silicon-city-cheeky-chicago">Cheeky Chicago</a> and <a title="Chicago UrbanBuddy" href="/blog/events/swc-tv-silicon-city-featuring-urbanbuddy">UrbanBuddy</a>. Tune in to this week’s episode featuring Co-Founders Samuel Pro and David Rogers of Chicago's TransitChatter.

<a title="SWC TV Presents Silicon City Featuring Chicago Start-up TransitChatter" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oQYFfvRDpQM?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-silicon-city-transitchatter.jpg" alt="SWC TV Presents Silicon City Featuring UrbanBuddy" width="474" height="262" /></a>

On this week’s episode of Silicon City, host Elliott Baretz, Vice President of Business Development and head of <a title="Chicago Digital Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">Digital Design services</a> at SWC discusses growing startup TransitChatter with Samuel Pro and David Rogers. TransitChatter is a mobile application that makes Chicago’s transit system a fun social experience. The application gives riders the ability to “connect to each other, the system, businesses and events that they pass by every day,” said Samuel. This unique mobile application allows riders to talk to each other and get local deals for the stops they are headed too. TransitChatter was built to enhance the experience for commuters on public transportation.

Being entrepreneurs came naturally for Samuel and David, who have extensive knowledge in digital design, coding and mobile application development. The idea of TransitChatter came after the realization that people were “missing out on a lot of opportunities and things to do,” said Samuel, “We use technology to address these problems.” David, who has a design background and Samuel, who has a technology background used their knowledge to create the UI design and development of the first mobile application. “I created the native versions of the iOS and Android for TransitChatter and it talks to Sam’s code,” said David. They outsourced their IT, when developing the Android mobile version, which later helped them create a better application through their own coding and design.

Currently, TransitChatter has 650 daily unique users and 80 paying businesses. Samuel and David have big plans for the future and expect these numbers to grow rapidly throughout 2013. If you are interested in learning more about TransitChatter download their free mobile application or head over to <a href="http://transitchatter.com/" target="_blank">TransitChatter</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We invited some very special guests to our office to see what they had to say about SWC and our solutions. Watch our video below to find out what kids are saying about SWC Technology Partners.

<a title="IT Consultants SWC - How Kids View Technology" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DKCwwTqBoLw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/featured-video_kids.jpg" alt="What Kids Think About SWC" width="474" height="262" /></a>

At <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC, we serve mid-market companies, helping them define, deploy and support technology solutions. We specialize in the following solutions:

<strong>Microsoft SharePoint:</strong> SWC has been working with <a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> since the inception of the product, deploying hundreds of SharePoint solutions in dozens of industries. Microsoft SharePoint helps our clients collaborate, communicate and manage documents and workflows. Our kids said that sharing was very important and if you have more of something than someone else, you should share with them.

<strong>Business Intelligence:</strong> SWC helps its clients gather and analyze data helping them make better business decisions. SWC has developed robust analysis solutions for multiple industries, including real estate, consumer product marketing, transportation and finance. When asked what <a title="Business Intelligence Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence</a> is, our kids got it right. They knew business intelligence was something that makes businesses work better.

<strong>Virtual Database Administrator (VDBA):</strong> SWC helps its clients get the most of their SQL database through its <a title="Virtual Database Administrator Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/virtual-dba">Virtual DBA</a> program, by offering extraordinary database expertise without an extraordinary increase to the payroll. Our kids weren’t so sure about this one!

<strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM):</strong> CRM solutions help SWC clients sell, manage and service their customers more effectively. SWC has extensive experience customizing and deploying <a title="Salesforce.com CRM" href="/solutions/crm/salesforce-com-customer-relationship-management">Salesforce.com</a> and <a title="Microsoft CRM Consulting" href="/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a>. When asked about CRM, our kids knew it was important to be good to your customers and keep them happy.

<strong>Microsoft System Center:</strong> SWC specializes in deploying System Center for mid-market organizations. Technology has a lot of moving parts and SWC clients leverage Microsoft System Center to put things in order. Our kids said that <a title="Microsoft System Center Services" href="solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center</a> is a center for systems and makes computers work.

<strong>Virtualization:</strong> Through <a title="Virtualization Consulting Services" href="/solutions/virtualization">virtualization</a>, SWC clients operate multiple servers on single hardware units reducing the need for space, power and administrative overhead. SWC specializes in the design and deployment of Microsoft Hyper V, VMware and Citrix virtualization solutions. Our kids suggested this makes things more virtual on a computer.

<strong>Microsoft Windows:</strong> Over 90% of all desktops run <a title="Microsoft Windows Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</a> as their operating system. Almost 50% of all desktops will upgrade to Windows 7 or 8 in the next twelve months. Our kids knew all about Microsoft and that it is a program that people create things from.

<strong>Unified Communications:</strong> <a title="Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications</a> is the consolidation of telephony, email, voicemail, calendaring, Instant Messaging (IM) and web conferencing in one system. SWC leverages Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Lync as the cornerstone of its Unified Communications solution. Our kids were very familiar with communicating through group chat, texting and Facebook.

<strong>Managed Services:</strong> Many SWC clients want to focus on their own business and not the technology that surrounds it. SWC teams with these organizations by providing 24/7 IT monitoring and support, which includes patching and updating, remediation and repair, remote and onsite services and strategic planning. Our kids said that <a title="Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services">Managed Services</a> is when people do things for you and they were right!

<strong>Web Design and SEO:</strong> Human beings decide if they like something in 1/10 of a second. Websites have to look good and be easy to use. SWC <a title="Chicago Digital Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">digital design</a> specializes in WordPress, SharePoint design and Search Engine Optimizations. Our favorite SWC pet had no comment on this.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft has introduced a wave of innovation in 2013 with the release of <a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-2013">SharePoint 2013</a>, <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Lync 2013</a> and Office 2013 that is changing the way we do business. But one of the big questions in IT is how to effectively and efficiently manage Microsoft’s new stack of products. At <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC, we have deployed Microsoft System Center for many mid-market organizations to help consolidate management and cost. System Center offers a breadth of capabilities and solutions for physical and virtual systems monitoring, management, backup and security. There are many products that comprise Microsoft System Center, in this blog I wanted to share a few tools that many companies are currently operating in their environments that System Center can replace.

<strong>System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)</strong>
System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) is a tool that can be used for desktop deployment and management. SCCM will impact your business and help you empower your users with all of the applications and devices they need, allowing them to become more productive, while IT still maintains control. System Center Configuration Manager can replace, the following products:
<ul>
	<li>Desktop imaging products, including Altiris, FOG, Ghost and Zenworks</li>
	<li>Application development products, including Flexera, Kayesa, and Specops</li>
	<li>Third-party AV products, including McAfee, Symantec, Trend, etc.</li>
	<li>Acronis, Kace and other inventory, reporting and imaging tools</li>
</ul>
<strong>System Center Operations Manager (SCOM)</strong>
System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) can be used to monitor and manage your infrastructure. The tool can provide application diagnostics and ensure all of your systems are available and performing. System Center Operations Manager can replace the following products for management and monitoring: BizMon, Frends, Helium, Minotaur, Solarwinds and Spiceworks.

<strong>System Center Data Protection Manager (SCDPM)</strong>
System Center Data Protection Manager (SCDPM) provides cost-effective data protection, replacing alternative products, such as Acronis, Backup Exec, CA, Commvault and replication tools. SCDPM can also be used to restore disk, tape and off premise scenarios.

<strong>System Center Service Manager (SCSM)</strong>
System Center Service Manager (SCSM) can be used as a Help Desk tool. The product can replace products like Assyst, CA, Manage Engine, Numara, Service Desk Plus and Trackit. It can also be used to replace any third party help desk ticketing software, especially ones that aren’t integrated with Active Directory.

<strong>System Center Endpoint Protection</strong>
System Center Endpoint Protection can be used as an anti-virus, consolidating security and management. The tool can be used to replace products like Symantec AV and spyware tools.

<strong>Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) / System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)</strong>
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) can be used to provide deployment services and virtual machine management for your environment, giving you a cost-effective private cloud. The tool can replace products like HyperV Manager , Failover Cluster Manager and Solarwinds Virtualization Manager.

<strong>System Center Orchestrator</strong>
System Center Orchestrator is a solution commonly used for workflow management. It is a good replacement for Puppet Automation and vCenter Orchestrator.

SWC currently offers a Microsoft System Center assessment and business managed tools analysis. As part of our assessment and analysis, we will look at the dozens of tools your business is currently using that could be replaced by Microsoft System Center, allowing you to consolidate management and costs. We will also provide a roadmap to deployment, if you’re an XP end of life candidate or looking into a desktop refresh, this will give you guidance on how to get you there. Finally, we also deliver mobile landscape recommendations as part of the assessment on how to use System Center for tablet management.

Whether it’s SCCM, SCDPM, SCSM, SCOM, SCVMM, or EndPoint Protection, or a hybrid approach, SWC can help you make sense of all of the Microsoft System Center tools, so that you can better manage your IT environment. The Power to manage is closer than you think with <a title="Microsoft System Center 2012" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center 2012</a>!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC Technology Partners, currently provides <a title="Virtual Database Administrator Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/virtual-dba">virtual database administration services</a> to help assess and maintain your <a title="Microsoft SQL Server Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server</a> environment. Our expert VDBA’s can complement your internal IT team, providing the SQL expertise needed to help resolve performance issues, reports that are taking too long to generate, slow running applications, or help you upgrade your SQL environment or add more BI assets, such as dashboards, reports and spreadsheets. Watch our video below to learn more about SWC’s VDBA solution, which starts with a SQL Server assessment.

<a title="Virtual Database Administrator SWC Technology Partners VDBA Services" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zluF1f06mpM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/featured-video_rachel-narel.jpg" alt="Virtual Database Administrator VDBA Services" width="560" height="315" /></a>

As part of SWC’s <a title="Microsoft SQL Server Assessment" href="/solutions/managed-services/virtual-dba">SQL Server assessment</a>, we look at your entire SQL environment, including maintenance plans, operating systems, Disaster Recovery, back-ups, memory and space allocations and temporary files. We then compare them to best practices and provide recommendations to implement that will improve performance and your environment. SWC can also look at any necessary remediation plans that need to take place.

As part of the SQL assessment, we provide you with two detailed documents, a summary document that high-levels your environment and the recommendations, and a very detailed document that goes through every minute detail of your SQL databases. This document can be used for Disaster Recovery, audit, or as a repository document that contains all of the information about your database. In some cases, we then partner with our clients for an ongoing monthly VDBA service to augment their internal IT team and provide SQL Server monitoring and maintenance over time. We watch the maintenance activities and logs and monitor for any alerts or anomalies in memory usage in your environment, so that you can focus on more strategic projects, while we take care of the day-to-day maintenance for you.

Consider allowing SWC to partner with you on a SQL server assessment!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC Technology Partners premieres another exciting episode of Silicon City! Silicon City is a bi-weekly web show focusing on the startup community in Chicago. This episode shows a unique view of the Chicago startup ecosystem. Watch this week’s episode featuring Peter Liu, Associate at New World Ventures.

<a title="SWC TV Presents Silicon City Featuring Peter Liu With Chicago VC New World Ventures" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6zb5nrcEwoI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-silicon-city-new-world-ventures.png" alt="SWC TV Presents Silicon City Featuring Peter Liu With New World Ventures" width="474" height="262" /></a>

On this week’s episode of Silicon City, host Elliott Baretz, Vice President of Business Development and head of <a title="Chicago Digital Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">Digital Design Services</a> at SWC discusses the Chicago ecosystem with Peter Liu. Peter is an Associate at New World Ventures, an investment firm that works with entrepreneurs to build leading <a title="Information Technology Company" href="/swc-technology-partners/about-swc">information technology companies</a>. New World Ventures is growing and currently has offices located in Chicago and Los Angeles.

“The Chicago market has really matured in the last couple years,” says Peter. Chicago has developed a lot of great people, companies and places that have contributed to the success of so many startups. Another great location promoting and helping startups is 1871. “It has really become the technology town hall for startups,” stated Peter. With mentors, educators and venture capitalists all in the same building, who wouldn’t want to be located in 1871?

Peter also gave some great insight for what New World Ventures is looking for in their next deal. “I know this will sound like a broken record but it's team, team, team…more often than not the team’s ability to execute is more important than the product itself. We are always evaluating the team whether it’s the initial meeting, the pitch, or in the boardroom. We’re seeing how you sell the companies, how you interact with your other co-founders and with your employees. It’s the team we believe is the real driver of a business. Other than that obviously we are looking for big innovative ideas that are creating a solution to problems that are out there in the market today,” said Peter. “In order to achieve success it is important to surround yourself with great people steering you in the right direction.”

Finally, Peter gave a word of advice for picking a venture capitalist. “We’re not investors at the end of the day, we are a partner,” he states. “You are in it for the long haul with a VC and need to make sure they can provide value to you in more sense than just their dollars. They should be able to help you open doors to customers, provide domain expertise or have access to entrepreneurs and folks who can really help you build your business.” To learn more about Peter Liu or New World Venture head over to <a href="http://www.newworldvc.com" target="_blank">newworldvc.com</a> or follow Peter on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/pdotliu" target="_blank">@Pdotliu</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At <a title="Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">consulting firm</a>, SWC, we deploy Microsoft Unified Communications solutions for our customers, including <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> as a voice platform and Microsoft Exchange as a voicemail platform. The 2013 release of these products offer today’s workplace a single solution that combines email, telephony, conferencing and instant messaging in an extremely intuitive and user friendly way.

When talking to prospects about SWC’s <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications</a> offering, many do not realize that Microsoft Exchange is an enterprise-ready voicemail solution. Watch our video below to learn more about Unified Communications and Unified Messaging with Microsoft Exchange.

<a title="Unified Communications &amp; Unified Messaging - Microsoft Exchange" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zcjXD4BvtMI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/anthony-caragol-unified-communications-consultant.jpg" alt="Unified Communications &amp; Unified Messaging - Microsoft Exchange" width="474" height="262" /></a>

<a title="Microsoft Exchange Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Microsoft Exchange</a> is not just an email platform; it’s also an enterprise ready voicemail solution that can integrate with your existing PBX, whether that s Avaya, Cisco, ShoreTel, Mitel or whatever you may have. Since most companies have already invested in Microsoft Exchange whether it’s on premise or in the cloud, adding voicemail capabilities isn’t that hard and can provide significant savings over paying continued maintenance and support for your existing voicemail solution.

Voicemail with Exchange offers all of the same standard features you would require from a voicemail solution, such as automated attendants or call trees, speech recognition and message waiting alerts. But there are also a lot of advanced features that are easy to use and accessible in the Microsoft Outlook Web App. One of the most popular features is receiving your voicemails to your Inbox as emails, with a Voice Mail Preview that includes a speech-to-text transcription. Other features include assigning personalized greetings for different callers and setting up call answering rules. Call answering rules give you the ability to transfer certain contacts to a different number, such as your cell phone. Microsoft’s Outlook Voice Access tool, also allows you to listen to your email and calendar information, accept and cancel meetings and set security preferences.

Why not give your voicemail to a platform your IT staff is already familiar with and trained on, that is resilient, proven and reliable for your infrastructure. Contact SWC today to talk about how Microsoft Exchange can help you meet your business objectives.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC, we deploy <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications solutions</a>, using Microsoft Lync as a voice platform and <a title="Microsoft Exchange 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Microsoft Exchange</a> as a voicemail platform. One cool Microsoft Lync feature is its ability to become your full voice solution, transforming your computer into a softphone. Watch our latest Microsoft Lync video to learn more about these exciting capabilities.

<a title="IT Consultants SWC - Microsoft Lync Voice Adoption" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AgSeKzYvNh8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-lync-voice-adoption.jpg" alt="Microsoft Lync Voice Adoption" width="474" height="262" /></a>

<a title="Microsoft Lync 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> is a great alternative to the traditional PBX system. The product can seamlessly integrate into your office phone or turn your laptop into a softphone through Microsoft Outlook. Additionally, Microsoft Lync has all of the features you would expect in a phone system, including call forwarding, transferring, the ability to put callers on hold, etc., but offers significant enhancements to your communications infrastructure through a single interface uniting your voice communications, IM, and audio, video, and web conferencing.

Since Microsoft Lync is tightly integrated into the Microsoft office suite, everything you can do from Lync, including making phone calls can be done from Microsoft Outlook, <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Consulting" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> or <a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM" href="/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a>. The ability to turn a user’s Microsoft applications into a communication system provides them with better opportunities to collaborate on projects and work together more efficiently and effectively in real time. Since, Microsoft Lync integrates into these programs users are already familiar with; there is a very little learning curve. The product is also highly intuitive and easy to use.

Microsoft Lync is a full featured and robust product with endless capabilities. At SWC, we are very excited about it and are seeing more and more companies roll out Microsoft Lync as a full voice platform. It’s a really fun and exciting time for Microsoft Lync voice adoption at SWC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite the fact that the information technology world has been talking about “The Cloud” and “Cloud-Based Solutions” for years now, the media hype seems to be going stronger than ever. I see articles every day about infrastructure and application hosting services, providers, considerations, challenges and more. Even with all the information out there, people still seem to be a bit confused about “The Cloud,” especially when it comes to deployment options for <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Solution" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a>.

The traditional deployment model is generally referred to as “On Premises,” meaning that the SharePoint server(s) are located within your internal IT infrastructure data center. While there are many potential configurations of servers and services that might be used in a SharePoint installation, the basic setup typically includes one SharePoint server to host the web application and related services and one <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server</a> to host the databases. In this scenario, the capital investment might be significant, since you will need to purchase licenses for Windows Server, SharePoint Server and SQL Server and probably “Client Access Licenses” for each named user that will be accessing the SharePoint environment. You will also need physical or virtual server machines for SharePoint and SQL Server, although you can leverage an existing database server if it has sufficient capacity.

For all that initial investment, you will get the benefits of owning your own SharePoint environment. That means there won't be any direct ongoing costs for the hardware and software. You will get access to all the functionality of SharePoint, without any of the limitations that some of the “In the Cloud” deployment models might impose. Of course, it also means that you will be entirely responsible for administering and supporting your SharePoint environment, either via internal resources or by engaging a partner to assist.

Of course, the alternative to an “On Premises” deployment is “In the Cloud.” That means the hardware and/or virtual server(s) running SharePoint exist somewhere besides your internal infrastructure data center. The hosting provider you choose typically owns and manages the servers and you can access the environment remotely via your internet connection. Rather than paying up front to buy the hardware and relevant software licenses, you generally rent it on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis. While the monthly operational investment will be a lot lower than the capital expense of buying everything, over time the “rental fees” can add up to more than it might cost to buy (kind of like buying vs. renting a house). Costs range from dollars per month per user to hundreds or even thousands per month per server, depending on how your chosen hosting provider prices their offerings.

Some of the benefits of the cloud hosting model include a more robust and well-connected facility to host the physical hardware, easier scalability as your organizational requirements grow over time, on-site technical specialists that can help with administration and support and additional services like monitoring, alerting, patching, updating and backup and disaster recovery. On flip side, the “In the Cloud” model often entails giving up significant control over your SharePoint solution and the content and data stored within. You might lose access to some of the capabilities of SharePoint, or face limitations on the types of things you can configure and customize. The security, auditing and compliance implications might be significant as well. Depending on your particular needs, such limitations might not matter, or they might be showstopper issues that preclude the use of a particular hosting provider or even the cloud model in general.

The bottom line is that the choice of where and how to host your SharePoint deployment might not be a simple one. There are a variety of key decision factors and relevant considerations. When you cross-reference that with the myriad of available options, it's not hard to quickly become overwhelmed. In trying to make a final decision on the right hosting option for your deployment, we recommend that you stay focused on the business priorities, and don't lose sight of the “total cost of ownership” in addition to the more obvious costs. As always, <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC stands ready to help you make the best choice possible.

		<title>How SWC &amp; Microsoft Lync Prevent Visibility Issues At Wittenstein</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When Wittenstein needed a telephony solution to combat global visibility issues, they turned to <a title="Chicago IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">Chicago area IT consulting firm</a>, SWC Technology Partners. SWC deployed Microsoft Lync, an enterprise-ready <a title="Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications</a> platform, which gives their users the ability to track their team’s availability and presence. Watch our video to learn more about how Wittenstein has found success using Microsoft Lync.

<a title="IT Consultants Perform Microsoft Lync Deployment For Wittenstein" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DGjUDumkEFg?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-lync-global-deployment-wittenstein.jpg" alt="Microsoft Lync Global Deployment" width="474" height="262" /></a>

<a title="Wittenstein" href="http://www.wittenstein-us.com" target="_blank">Wittenstein</a> is a global provider of precision planetary gearboxes, selling to industries such as machine tool, packaging and semiconductor equipment companies. They had been experiencing some visibility issues with their old phone system, as customer service teams were unable to see which agents were or weren’t available, resulting in phone calls getting transferred from customers to customer service agents that would get dropped.

SWC designed and deployed <a title="Microsoft Lync Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> for Wittenstein’s global infrastructure to give them better insight into their customer service team’s presence. SWC helped Wittenstein transition to the new Lync phone system on a Friday afternoon, so that when employees arrived back to work on Monday morning, they were up and running on the new system. It was an extremely smooth transition.

One of the biggest advantages Wittenstein now has with the new Lync phone system is the presence indicator. They can see where everyone is at, at any given time. Since Microsoft Lync is fully integrated into their Microsoft Office and <a title="Microsoft Exchange Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Microsoft Exchange</a> products, the team’s calendars automatically update, so someone can see if they’re away, on the phone or in a meeting. When customers now call into the operator, she knows who is available to respond to each request.

Wittenstein’s customer service teams are now able to better integrate and collaborate with their outside sales teams. Microsoft Lync has given them the ability to easily have phone conversations, send instant messages or start an audio, video or web conference with the click of a mouse. These tools give them the ability to disseminate important information as quickly as possible.

The project was a huge success. SWC supported Wittenstein the whole way, starting with the design phase to create a global infrastructure through the knowledge transfer at the end, enabling internal training for their users. After the implementation, Wittenstein became part of SWC’s <a title="Microsoft Lync Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/microsoft-lync-managed-services">Lync Managed Services</a> program and receives 24/7 monitoring and support for their Lync environment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC Technology Partners showcases another episode of Silicon City! Silicon City highlights the startup community in Chicago by interviewing various startups and people involved in the technology scene. Watch this week’s episode featuring Sarah Hatter, Founder and CEO of CoSupport.

<a title="Silicon City Featuring Sarah Hatter Of Chicago's CoSupport" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XL8LuZWTz1Q?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-silicon-city-chicago-cosupport.png" alt="SWC Silicon City CoSupport" width="474" height="262" /></a>

On this week’s episode of Silicon City, host Elliott Baretz, Vice President of Business Development and head of <a title="Chicago Digital Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">Digital Design Services</a> at SWC discuss why it’s so important to have great customer service with Sarah Hatter, CEO and Founder of CoSupport. CoSupport offers expert customer support training for web and mobile applications with a goal to make the web better customer by customer.

The tech scene is growing at a rapid pace in Chicago and many companies are unsure how to provide customer support and connect with their customers. CoSupport uses a variety of facets including speaking engagements and executive training to help clients with all of their customer support needs. “Customer support is part of your marketing” said Sarah. You have to remember, all customers “have a say and they can do it so quickly.” With mobile applications, such as Yelp, customers can now write bad reviews in seconds. Many companies need to be aware and able to provide support for their customers.

“We have golden rules of how to start providing customer support,” said Sarah. “You need to use an actual help desk, not just email. You also need to have help and educational sections to help eliminate the need of someone at the other end of the phone or email. This starts with educational material, how to videos and searchable help sections with screenshots that someone does not have to speak English to see how it works. Beyond that, training people with great language how to respond to customers and teach the mechanics of triaging, prioritizing and how to report bug recognition. This is not stuff that there is any school for, you can’t get a degree in how to speak to any developer.”

Sarah started this company after working in technology for several years and the realization of the need for customer support. She says her passion in customer support “comes from a place of such internal rage about the state of how customers are treated in our world right now.” Sarah’s goal is to create a great support system by humanizing the interaction between companies and their customers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 2013 release of <a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> offers today’s workplace a powerful platform to increase company-wide communication, collaboration and workforce productivity. Watch our video below to learn more about how organizations are deploying meaningful SharePoint assets and using SWC to manage them.

<a title="Chicago Area Microsoft SharePoint Managed Services" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-EajcjaZagk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-sharepoint-managed-services-chicago.jpg" alt="Microsoft SharePoint Managed Services Chicago" width="474" height="262" /></a>

Microsoft SharePoint is a very powerful and complex product that many companies need help deploying right out of the gate. As much as SWC can provide the services to get SharePoint up and running for your users, there are always going to be continual things that are going to happen to your site, where routine monitoring and maintenance services will need to be completed.

To truly manage a robust product, like SharePoint, there are all sorts of expertise your team must have. For instance, if you want to do a custom designed site you will need to be able to do HTML, CSS and all sorts of graphic design. If you need to manage the backend of your SharePoint site, you will need to know Sequel (SQL) and all types of <a title="Virtualization Consulting Services" href="/solutions/virtualization">virtualization technologies</a>, if you’re doing that. There is also a lot of Server OS level expertise you must have. Finally, you will need to deploy new document libraries and set up permissions and so many more of the site’s features and functionalities. Basically, there are a lot of aspects into how Microsoft SharePoint actually leverages all of your company’s networking and collaboration tools and it can take a team of expert technologists to ensure optimal performance.

After the product is deployed, SWC Technology Partners’ <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/microsoft-sharepoint-managed-services">SharePoint Managed Services</a> offering helps those customers that need support.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT Consulting Firm</a>, SWC Technology Partners releases another episode of Silicon City. Silicon City gives viewers an inside look at the startup community in Chicago. Guests in the past have included many exciting companies and people such as Cheeky Chicago, Sarah Hatter and Peter Liu. Watch this week’s episode to get an inside look at Trunk Club, one of the largest growing startups in Chicago.

<a title="Silicon City Featuring Rob Chesney Of Chicago’s Trunk Club" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EFqKfq3RIkk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-silicon-city-chicago-trunk-club.png" alt="SWC Silicon City Trunk Club" width="474" height="262" /></a>

On this week’s episode, host Elliott Baretz, Vice President of Business Development and head of <a title="Chicago Digital Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">Digital Design Services</a> at SWC and Rob Chesney, Chief Operating Officer at Trunk Club discuss Trunk Club and the Chicago startup scene. Trunk Club is set out to solve the problem behind the men’s shopping experience. “What we really set out to do was design experiences tailored to how a guy might like to shop,” said Rob. Trunk Club makes it simple for customers to have a quick, simple shopping experience that gives them exactly what they want and leaves them wanting more.

“Customers sign up for our service, we then assign them a stylist, a real human being who connects with them and learns more about their needs and wants and deliver custom solutions to them in terms of building their wardrobe,” stated Rob. But, Trunk Club has a lot more to offer. “If you’re in Chicago, you can come into Trunk Club. Your stylist will hand pick outfits for you, you can have a drink at our bar, your stylist will walk you through what they picked out and you can have this really great non retail fun experience.”

Behind the scenes, Trunk Club is more than just stylists and clothes. Data is constantly being collected to improve the customer experience making information technology a very important part of Trunk Club’s business model. “This business only scales if we can build the right software and technology,” said Rob. Currently Trunk Club uses <a title="Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm">customer relationship management</a> (CRM) system <a title="Salesforce.com CRM" href="/solutions/crm/salesforce-com-customer-relationship-management">Salesforce.com</a> to connect with customers and gain vital information. “Salesforce has been a phenomenal partner to the business,” stated Rob. “We use Salesforce in lots of different ways across our business. One of the core ways is around their CRM product. We also have built a lot of tools to help assist our stylists and customers.”

Trunk club is a little over 3 ½ years old and is growing rapidly. Their positive atmosphere and fun culture proves to be moving them forward. The next time you are in Chicago make sure to check out Trunk Club to get fitted by a stylist, have a drink at the bar or enjoy the views from their rooftop patio. To learn more about Trunk Club, download their mobile application or head over to <a href="http://www.trunkclub.com" target="_blank">trunkclub.com</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At <a title="Chciago IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC, we have honed the ability to create rich and beautiful <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Chicago" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> environments that provide our customers with an easy, intuitive and rewarding experience. We have also established a proven methodology, through the SWC SharePoint Way to help our customers deploy the right SharePoint solution to meets their business needs. We are excited to share with you our new SharePoint portfolio showcasing some of these projects. Please click on the image below to see how we have helped our customers find success using Microsoft SharePoint.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/design-portfolio/sharepoint"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9563 aligncenter" title="SWC SharPoint Consulting Design Portfolio" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-sharpoint-consulting-design-portfolio-300x286.jpg" alt="SWC SharPoint Consulting Design Portfolio" width="300" height="286" /></a></p>
SWC has helped our clients find success by creating Microsoft SharePoint solutions that focused on:
<ul>
	<li>Building Communities</li>
	<li>Managing Documents</li>
	<li>Connecting with Customers</li>
	<li>Driving Efficiencies</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/design-portfolio/sharepoint/havi-group"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9561 aligncenter" title="Havi Group SharePoint Design" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/havi-group-sharepoint-design-300x195.jpg" alt="Havi Group SharePoint Design" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>

<h2>Building Communities</h2>
SWC has helped many organizations use Microsoft SharePoint to help build a better sense of community amongst their employees and increase internal communication. Microsoft SharePoint provides a place for employees to connect with one another and easily access important company information such as announcements and news, directories, documents, performance indicators and policies through one centralized location. Larger organizations have found success using Microsoft SharePoint to help bring together geographically dispersed teams, providing them with a better sense of community and allowing them to feel more connected. SWC’s <a title="Chicago Digital Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">Digital Design team</a> has worked with our Software Solutions Group to deliver sites that feature integrated design and branding elements depicting an organization’s mission, culture and values. These elements not only enhance the site’s overall impact, but instill a deep employee connection to the brand. Since Microsoft SharePoint gives employees the ability to collaborate and work together more efficiently, through team discussion sites, document management and integration with other Microsoft stack products such as <a title="Microsoft Lync Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> for real time presence and Unified Messaging capabilities, it makes building an internal community easy.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/design-portfolio/sharepoint/daco"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9560 aligncenter" title="Daco Incorporated SharePoint Design" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/daco-incorporated-sharepoint-design-300x205.jpg" alt="Daco Incorporated SharePoint Design" width="300" height="205" /></a></p>

<h2>Managing Documents</h2>
At its core, Microsoft SharePoint is a document management and collaboration platform. By incorporating custom and unique search capabilities into document management elements, SWC has helped many organizations easily find the critical documents they need. Custom designed search tools allow users to slice and view documents through custom-built content based search parameters. Enhanced document management platforms lead to increased efficiency and effective collaboration between teams, who can quickly locate all of the critical information and data they need to complete their projects. Further integration of additional Microsoft stack products, such as <a title="Microsoft CRM Consulting" href="/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Microsoft CRM</a>, gives users the ability to access more of the documents, data and information needed to meet business objectives and drive revenue.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/design-portfolio/sharepoint/tcs"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9559 aligncenter" title="Chicago School Professional Psychology SharePoint Design" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/chicago-school-psychology-sharepoint-design-300x195.jpg" alt="Chicago School Professional Psychology SharePoint Design" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>

<h2>Connecting with Customers</h2>
Microsoft SharePoint can be used as a powerful portal to connect with customers and other external users. SWC has created external SharePoint sites and client portals that are easy to navigate and cater to their customer’s needs, while maintaining a brand’s corporate look and feel. Additional capabilities allow firms to socialize, share, collaborate and work together on projects with their customers and external stakeholders, maximizing the investments they made in Microsoft SharePoint.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/design-portfolio/sharepoint/plymouth"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9562 aligncenter" title="Plymouth Tube SharePoint Design" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/plymouth-tube-sharepoint-design-300x195.jpg" alt="Plymouth Tube SharePoint Design" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>

<h2>Driving Efficiencies</h2>
Through document management and workflows, Microsoft SharePoint gives businesses the power to drive efficiencies and increase productivity. SWC has created SharePoint sites that have become a place that employees want to go to collaborate on projects and initiatives. Microsoft SharePoint provides a platform for companies to quickly disseminate important information and enhance corporate communication initiatives that drive efficiencies across the board.

		<title>What Chicago Area Businesses Are Saying About Microsoft Lync</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At <a title="Unified Communications Specialists" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications specialists</a>, SWC, we have heard a lot of positive feedback from our customers where we have deployed Microsoft Lync Server. The 2013 release of this product has made it even easier for them to communicate on any device, anywhere. Watch our video below to learn more about what our customers are saying they like best about Microsoft Lync.

<a title="What Chicago Area Businesses Are Saying About Microsoft Lync" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7QJysiO-wlg?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/chicago-businesses-microsoft-lync.jpg" alt="Chicago Businesses Microsoft Lync" width="474" height="262" /></a>

One of the first areas we hear positive feedback from our customers is around Microsoft Lync’s user experience. The ability to provide instant messaging, presence, conferencing and voice services throughout the entire Microsoft stack is a tremendous advantage. New and improved <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync 2013</a> features make communication easy, through an intuitive, consistent and familiar experience across all devices. One simple click on a PC or touch on a smartphone or tablet gives them the ability to call, instant message or start an audio or video conference effortlessly. Lync 2013 also offers a high-quality user experience through HD video.

The second area we hear a lot of positive feedback from our customers is around the ROI of a Unified Communications solution by Microsoft, specifically around their Microsoft Licensing Agreements. Most of our customers have heavily invested in Microsoft technologies and therefore own good portions of the technology that is necessary for Microsoft Unified Communications. Alternatively, after the solution is deployed, Microsoft Lync can help cut travel costs through conferencing and desktop sharing.

A third key area our customers really like about Microsoft Lync is <a title="Chicago Managed IT Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">IT support</a>. The majority of the customers we work with have a great deal of knowledge and capabilities in managing and monitoring existing Microsoft technology solutions, Microsoft Lync is no different.

To learn more about Microsoft Lync and how <a title="IT Consultants" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consultants</a> SWC can assist your Chicago area business, please register to attend one of our upcoming <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications Event" href="/events">Microsoft Unified Communications events</a> or follow <a title="Adam Ferguson LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/adam-ferguson/32/71/4b4" target="_blank">Adam Ferguson on LinkedIn</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft’s ‘better together’ concept has proven to deliver and help businesses streamline their overall approach to<a title="Chicago Managed IT Operations" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions"> IT operations</a> and management. The <a title="Microsoft System Center Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center</a> suite continues to be a great example of how the ‘better together’ strategy is working for our customers, giving them the ability to proactively and efficiently monitor and manage their entire infrastructure. As Microsoft continues to create homogeneous technology solutions that make individuals and IT professionals more productive, SWC continues to evolve its Microsoft System Center practice to help our customers deploy technology solutions that work ‘better together.’

In this blog, I wanted to highlight some of the new Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 features that can help boost and enhance the functionality of your Microsoft System Center managed private cloud. Let’s take a look at how these two products work ‘better together.’
<h2>Storage Transformed</h2>
Windows Server 2012 R2 has a new feature called Storage Spaces that transforms the way you store your data. Storage Spaces automatically deliver breakthrough performance at a fraction of the cost. This is accomplished through a new storage tiering feature which tiers data across hard disks and solid state drives based on usage. It can significantly improve storage performance and cost efficiency across your organization. Windows Server 2012 R2’s new capabilities work ‘better together’ with Microsoft System Center by allowing us to better provision and transform storage in our managed private cloud.
<h2>Software Defined Networking</h2>
Windows Server 2012 R2 has taken agility and flexibility to a new level. The <a title="Network Virtualization" href="/solutions/virtualization">network virtualization</a> capabilities of Windows Server 2012 R2 and Microsoft System Center’s management capabilities work ‘better together’ by giving customers the ability to place any virtual machine on any node regardless of the IP address, with isolation. Windows Server 2012 R2 also provides a new in-box gateway feature that delivers internet access to virtual networks and full connectivity to physical networks, giving you the ability to easily extend your virtual network.
<h2>Live Migration and Virtualization</h2>
Windows Server 2012 R2’s cross-version live migration offers high-performance through an integrated virtualization platform for the virtual machines its running. Some of the benefits of running the new live migration compression include significant time savings (nearly 50%) using spare CPU cycles to compress live migration traffic. This requires no special hardware. Live migrations can be made even faster when using RDMA, which helps to enable the offloading of processes to the NICs (if they support RDMA). This is supported in Microsoft System Center’s Virtual Machine Manager and another reason why we think Windows Server 2012 and Microsoft System Center work ‘better together.’
<h2>Information and Access Protection</h2>
Windows Server 2012 R2 supports Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) programs that empower users to be more productive by working on their own personal devices. Microsoft System Center makes the process work ‘better together’ by providing users with a consistent experience across their devices through an easy and secure registration process. System Center also gives IT professionals the ability to manage these devices, mitigate risk and maintain security and control over corporate information through policy-based access control for both on-premises and cloud-based applications.
<h2>Java Application Monitoring</h2>
Windows Server 2012 R2 has new features that facilitate deep application insight into your Java applications. The new tools offer a variety of insight into performance and exception events as well as level alerting within Microsoft System Center’s Operations Manager. These two products are ‘better together’ offering traceability in the line-of-code level and performance and exception metrics for .NET and Java application monitoring. This leads to a dev-ops collaboration process that is tool-driven and more actionable. Additionally Windows Server 2012 R2 supports Java JDK, Tomcat and other Java web services frameworks.

There are so many ways Microsoft System Center and Windows Server 2012 R2 work ‘better together,’ with new features and benefits that enhance and streamline IT operations and management.

		<title>Microsoft Lync 2013: Cutting Costs and Helping Businesses Grow</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s a no brainer that <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync 2013</a> can save your business money by combining an enterprise phone system, audio and video conferencing, instant messaging, mobile connectivity and presentation applications. There are many case studies out there that tell us this. For example, “Corporation X saved 70% by switching their third party video conferencing provider to Microsoft Lync 2013.” Or “Acme, Inc. was able to cut travel costs 50% by using Microsoft Lync’s web and teleconferencing applications.” Or “Widget Worldwide was able to cut IT and telephony labor costs by switching to Lync 2013.” I found quite a few on them online, produced by <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/lync/microsoft-lync-customer-stories-video-conferencing-and-instant-messaging-software-reviews-FX103789712.aspx?redir=0" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>, detailing how the solution is saving businesses money. Or you can check out one of SWC’s own video case studies describing how Microsoft Lync has improved business operations at <a title="Wittenstein Lync Global Deployment" href="http://www.swc.com/perspective/videos/wittenstein-microsoft-lync-global-deployment">Wittenstein</a>.

My point is Microsoft Lync 2013 will save your business money by reducing the costs incurred with purchasing and maintaining a PBX system, third party conferencing solutions and travel and meeting expenses. But did you know that Microsoft Lync can also help grow your business?

Lync 2013’s integration with Microsoft Exchange, backend applications and Microsoft SharePoint is not just new technology, but a game changer in how we communicate, work and get things done. With Lync 2013 you are able to get the right people together in real time to complete projects faster and more efficiently. Processes that used to take several meetings, conference calls and emails to complete can be fast tracked through Lync 2013, using real-time applications like video conferencing and enabling screen sharing.

Lync 2013 has also been effective in motivating employees. Lync 2013 provides a rich presence that will encourage more communication and collaboration between teams. Employees are able to communicate faster, share what’s going on in their world and feel more connected to their fellow co-workers. It can make the workplace a much happier place to be. And, we always say that happy employees make happy customers and happy customers bring huge growth potential and a bright future for your business.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT Consulting Firm</a>, SWC Technology Partners, announces a new episode of Silicon City featuring former Chicago Bears player, Hunter Hillenmeyer. Silicon City is a web show focusing on the startup community in Chicago. Watch this week’s episode featuring Founder/President of OverDog, Hunter Hillenmeyer discussing his startup and transition from a professional football player to a business owner.

<a title="Silicon City Featuring Hunter Hillenmeyer Of OverDog" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ak0_RBmQi_M?rel=0&amp;autoplay=1" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-silicon-city-hunter-hillenmeyer.jpg" alt="Silicon City Featuring Hunter Hillenmeyer Of OverDog" width="474" height="262" /></a>

On this week’s episode of Silicon City, Elliott Baretz, Vice President of Business Development and head of <a title="Chicago Digital Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">Digital Design Services</a> at SWC discusses growing startup OverDog with Hunter Hillenmeyer. OverDog connects fans with their favorite athletes on Xbox and PlayStation. Athletes create challenges on their mobile phone which are sent out to fans, allowing them to play one-on-one.

Headquartered in Nashville Tennessee, OverDog is a growing platform with roughly 200 athletes using the mobile app. The app allows fans to have a more personal connection with players and players to connect with fans on a different level. “A huge portion of athletes go home and spend hours every day playing video games. That is a behavior that they share with their fans,” stated Hunter. “Athletes are young, they have a ton of free time, they have a lot of disposable income and relative to the general population, they are uber competitive. That set of features makes them perfect candidates to be gamers.”

Hunter took off his helmet in early 2011 to pursue a MBA at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and eventually became part of OverDog. “I was never planning on making a career out of football, which gave me the advantage of always trying to figure out what was next and put myself in the best position to capitalize on that. Which is why I went to business school in the first place,” said Hunter. “I went to Kellogg in a serious of off seasons while I was playing. I think a lot of steps, perhaps that I unwittingly took, made the transition out of the game a lot easier.” When asked what he missed most about the game, Hunter added, “I don’t miss the physicality of it. I miss the team, the guys and the locker room culture. I miss Sundays and that competitive rush of a Sunday NFL football game.”

This fall, OverDog plans to market their app more and equip athletes to promote OverDog further. The next time you game, be sure to check out OverDog to play against your favorite player. To learn more about OverDog, download their mobile app or head over to <a href="http://www.gameonoverdog.com/" target="_blank">gameoverdog.com</a>.

		<title>Microsoft Unified Communications: A Software Solution</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[People sometimes ask why they should deploy <a title="Microsoft Lync Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> as a telephony solution. They know all the other players that have been around for years and have built up trust around their systems and solutions. So, what is a software company doing in a traditionally hardware based market and how do I know they’re the right partner for me?

The answer is pretty straight-forward. The future of telephony is Unified Communications, simply put; all of your communications such as email, voicemail, telephone, video conferencing and instant messaging are converging into a single platform accessible from anywhere. Knowing this, it becomes clear that <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications</a> is a software solution and that the hardware vendors such as Avaya, Cisco, Mitel and ShoreTel need to provide software to make this happen. The problem is, software hasn’t been their main focus and you often end up seeing a mish mash of various applications that kind of integrate, but don’t really work that well together. It becomes more applications on the desktop that your users need to learn. Some vendors even try to develop plugins for Microsoft Lync, but the ease of use and simplicity of the solution is lost, as they change the way Lync works best.

In the end, nobody can integrate with Windows and your Microsoft Office suite like Microsoft can. Microsoft Lync seamlessly integrates with Outlook, Exchange, SharePoint, CRM and many other applications making it easy on your users to learn and use. They’re already familiar with Office and this just extends the capabilities in a natural way, ensuring quick and easy adoption. The same is true of your IT staff, you’ve already got Microsoft experts, why make people support a PBX solution that isn’t the right answer for your business? The more you think about it, it’s clear that the future of telephony is a software solution, and nobody can do it better than Microsoft.

		<title>Security Awareness: Tips for Protecting Your Online Identity from Hackers</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/managed-services/security-awareness-protecting-online-identity-from-hackers</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hackers are after your online identity. They want access to your e-mail, your online checking and even your Facebook account. It is increasingly common for attacks to come from other hijacked accounts and Facebook is a popular one. You get a message from your friend who says they’re overseas and had their wallet and plane tickets stolen, they need you to send them some cash. This is just one of many popular scams that hackers try once they have access to your online accounts.

So how do you protect your online identity from hackers? Passwords are obviously the first step and hackers have plenty of ways of stealing your passwords – social engineering and phishing scams, viruses or downloading an entire database of accounts from an insecure website or forum. Your best defense is a long password (9 characters or more), containing numbers, punctuation marks and letters (upper and lower case). Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts – your Facebook password shouldn’t be the same as your online banking website! You should also be changing your passwords regularly. Personally, I prefer to use passphrases, something like “You can’t touch this!” it fulfills the length and complexity requirements but it’s also easy to remember and fun.

Never give your password to anyone, period. Most phishing attacks are after personally identifiable information, passwords or simply money. They might appear to come from a service you use, like Chase or Amazon, but there’s a few simple ways you can tell whether an e-mail is actually from a legitimate organization. Never reply to e-mails requesting any personal information, including your social security number, credit card number, PIN or credit card security code, your mother’s maiden name or your password. If a company needs this information you should enter it on their website – never in an e-mail. Communication from professional companies generally do not contain spelling mistakes or grammatical errors and should never have unsolicited attachments. Do not open any attachment from anyone that you were not expecting! Check links before clicking them, hover your mouse over the link and check the status bar at the bottom of the page to see where it goes. If it’s an e-mail from Amazon.com it will read https://something.amazon.com/.

Make sure you regularly apply updates for both <a title="Microsoft Windows Consulting" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and your anti-virus software; this will keep those pesky viruses away. The truth is most malware that infects corporate networks today is not the result of surfing dangerous sites for illegal software or pornography, but legitimate small business websites that have been compromised by hackers. Small business IT teams do not have the resources to combat cyber-crime, and it may be weeks or months before the break-in is identified and offensive code removed from their website. These compromised websites then use known exploits for Java, Flash, Adobe Acrobat or internet browsers themselves to infect machines all over the country. Users can protect themselves by keeping their software up-to-date and recognizing warnings about unsecure websites and plugins.

What about protecting your information at home? The Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome internet browsers will both disable older versions of plugins that could make your PC vulnerable and most home users will not need to use a specific application that requires an outdated, insecure version of Java. There are also password management services like <a href="http://www.lastpass.com" target="_blank">www.LastPass.com</a> which have plugins for Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. This service automatically fills in forms allowing the user to choose very long, random passwords. Finally, do not disable User Account Control (UAC) in windows; UAC is a security feature which helps prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. If UAC is enabled and a virus tries to infect the PC the user will be prompted to allow the change – if the user clicks “No,, the virus is stopped in its tracks.

		<title>Sales Lessons From My Father</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My dad grew up in New York City shortly after World War II. Both of his parents worked, so he became one of the countless children who would define the term “latch key kid” – coming home to an empty apartment and learning the ways of the world alone.

Alone can mean a lot of things, but to my father it meant alone and without money, which meant alone with nothing to do. The other day I caught my old man imparting this part of his childhood to my own kids. We were at a local burger joint and I had stepped away to grab some ketchup. As I came back to the table I could hear him pontificating.

“You know how I solved this problem kids?” I heard him say.

“We don’t care,” my children responded.

“You care,” he replied. “You care because there is a good lesson in this story.”

He lost them at lesson.

“Listen or you don’t get ketchup,” I said. It was the best I could do and by some miracle it worked. Both of them shut up and looked over at my father.

“I learned how to sell. Do you know what I sold? I sold pencils. Can you two imagine that I sold pencils door to door?”

I had heard this story, which in truth is an impressive little ditty. Indeed he had sold pencils and at the age of eleven and had found the courage and initiative to “find” some inventory. Living in an apartment building, he went door to door, floor to floor selling number two pencils to his neighbors. In the end, he made enough money to do whatever eleven year olds did in New York during the early fifties.

When my dad tells the story it tends to focus on his impressive selling skills and how pencils turned into more substantial products and how the art of selling has been lost over time. Usually he has something to say about technology and how it’s the problem with people today. We’re too busy staring at our phones and communicating through text that we have forgotten how to complete a sentence.

Lately I have gotten something else out of his tale.

Because I spend all of my time thinking about technology and <a title="Chicago Digital Marketing Services" href="/solutions/digital-design">digital marketing</a>, I tend to draw things back to that facet. As I listened to my father speak I kept imagining him with his pencils, looking up at some unsuspecting neighbor and at times (despite his superior sales skills) getting the door slammed in his face. My guess is that he had very little time before his first sentence and the door actually butting up against his nose. And I think, the more things change, the more they stay the same.

Today, when we talk about websites we usually focus on the reality that we have very little time to make our point – actually 20 seconds. According to the Nielsen Norman group the probability of a visitor leaving a webpage in the first 10 seconds is exceedingly high. If the viewer makes it past 20 seconds there is a much higher propensity to stay. It seems like a “no duh” statement but it’s a reality. In many ways we are like my father with the pencils. We have to quickly convey our intent in a compelling way and create a call to action.

That’s the digital lesson in all of this. And it’s a reminder – anything and everything we create on the web should be (1) compelling; (2) concise and lead to a (3) call to action. If you are not hitting these three items you are going to end up with a bunch a pencils and a lonely afternoon at home.

“Good lesson, huh kids?” I ask.

Both look at me and with a shared expression of pity ask for the ketchup.

		<title>Microsoft Lync Weathers The Storm</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whether its rain, snow, sleet or hail, <a title="Microsoft Lync Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> offers by far the best solution for bad weather! Unlike many other VoIP systems, which require complex VPN setups for their external phones, Microsoft Lync phones can be taken off-campus and simply plugged into a home network, so that users can sign in conveniently from wherever they are. For companies that have a mobile workforce or in the event of bad weather, Microsoft Lync can keep your office or call center up and running, on or offsite.

Microsoft Lync gives users the capability to make voice calls from their computers, smartphones and mobile devices or with a Lync enabled desk phone. Using these devices is easy; users just follow the same steps they complete in the office, enabling them to answer business calls as if they were on your corporate LAN.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10295" title="Microsoft Lync Platforms And Devices" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-lync-platforms-devices-600.jpg" alt="Microsoft Lync Platforms And Devices" width="600" height="373" />

A great example of Lync weathering the storm is SWC’s <a title="Chicago Managed IT Services" href="/solutions/managed-services">Managed Services</a> Help/Service Desk. SWC’s <a title="Managed Help Desk Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-help-desk-service-desk-services">Service Desk</a> provides 24x7 support to many customers – rain or shine. During this past winter, massive amounts of snow threatened SWC’s service desk workers’ ability to get safely to work. Microsoft Lync came to the rescue, enabling employees to take their desk phones home with them the night before, giving them the option to answer direct calls and call center calls from the comfort of home, minimizing the risk of driving in the snow and hazardous conditions, but also ensuring continued operations and 24x7 service and support to customers.

Why risk your worker’s health or the health of your business when the roads are unsafe due to bad weather? With Microsoft Lync, there’s no need to have your workforce or your business suffer – just take your phones home and work as if you are in the office. Your employees will appreciate the flexibility and your customers will appreciate your ability to remain available for them during bad weather. Fall is here and winter is right around the corner – work safe, work anywhere with Microsoft Lync.

We asked our sales team lead to share one of her favorite CRM tools that is helping make our sales team more productive. Watch this week’s “Ask SWC” video to learn more.

<a title="Great CRM Tool For Your Sales Team" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VrKHUezPPn8?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>

In this episode of “Ask SWC,” our Sales Team Lead, Elaine Green sits down to discuss her favorite feature of CRM, the contact dialer. The contact dialer is a CRM tool our sales team cannot live without. Within this custom built application, the sales team is able run advanced find searches within CRM based on certain criteria, such as area codes or job titles. They are then able to pull all of the data they find into a simple yet robust dialer screen. For example, the sales team can run a query on IT analysts to invite to an upcoming Chicago event. The tool instantly sorts through thousands of contacts providing the team with a list to directly target, saving them time. Using the contact dialer ensures our sales team is calling on the right contacts at the right time for the right event, making them more productive and efficient.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Throughout the course of the business day, do you realize how many “small things” take time away from big picture goals? Waiting for a colleague to reply to your email? Looking for the Sales Manager who may or may not be in the office? Scrolling through reply after reply on a long chain of emails, or even trying to cobble together different chains of emails that should all be in one place?

With <a title="Microsoft Lync Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> at your disposal you can spend your time and energy on the big picture. Instant messaging through Lync provides real time communication. No more waiting for email replies; just send an instant message to your colleague. No more wandering the halls looking for people, when Microsoft Lync’s presence indicator provides visibility into the immediate whereabouts of your contacts – from their physical location to their current availability for chat or a phone call. It even gives you the ability to schedule an impromptu meeting with team members dispersed in several geographic areas.

Another useful <a title="Chicago Unified Communications" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications</a> feature in Lync is its persistent chat capabilities. Persistent chat provides collaboration by consolidating group communication into a single location. Persistent chat rooms even retain that communication for future reference. Lync Meetings are also a great way to collaborate with team members near or far. With video and voice capabilities, as well as application, desktop and file sharing technologies native to Lync, there is nothing you can’t effectively and easily communicate.

Stop sweating the small stuff and let Microsoft Lync increase your productivity, enhance your visibility and improve your ability to communicate.

To learn more about SWC’s Microsoft Lync solution offering, please join us for our next <a title="Unified Communications Event" href="/events">Unified Communications event</a> or follow <a title="Anthony Caragol LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anthony-caragol/6/48/488" target="_blank">Anthony Caragol</a> on LinkedIn.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The word of the day is Chatter. What is Chatter? We like to think of it as <a title="Salesforce.com CRM" href="/solutions/crm/salesforce-com-customer-relationship-management">Salesforce.com</a>’s version of Twitter. Watch this week’s episode of ‘Ask SWC’ to learn more about this cool new feature and how it’s helping organizations connect with their customers in real-time and new ways.

<a title="Salesforce Goes Social With Chatter" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9sg4M_K8cuo?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>

Salesforce.com is a cloud based <a title="Customer Relationship Management Services" href="/solutions/crm">Customer Relationship Management</a> (CRM) solution for sales force automation, customer service, partner management and marketing and campaign management. The solution’s ability to be on top of every lead, opportunity and customer interaction provides a huge advantage for users. One of the ways the platform does this is through a new social business feature called Chatter.

Chatter helps Salesforce.com users to build secure online communities by connecting users, groups and customers in a constant dialog. Once a user logs into their Salesforce.com account, they can use the Chatter feature to hashtag different events and tag people, so that they will be included in conversations that are relevant to them. By looking through your Salesforce Chatter feed, you can see anything that you were tagged in or any topics that were hashtagged that you may be interested in learning more about. Chatter is a great new feature that helps users quickly find experts, increase resolution time, convert more sales and make decisions faster.

If you would like to chat about chatter, please join us for our next informative <a title="Salesforce.com Events" href="/events">Salesforce.com event</a> or follow our Go-To-Market leader <a title="Elliott Baretz LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/elliott-baretz/6/582/272" target="_blank">Elliott Baretz on LinkedIn</a>.

		<title>Microsoft Unified Communications: A Process Transformer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most of the customers who contact SWC about our <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications services</a>, are looking to replace their existing telephony solution. Initially, they are looking for something with new features that will allow them to continue to communicate and conduct business in the same ways they are used to communicating with one another. Microsoft Unified Communications has often been called a disruptor in this area and for good reason. Many clients, who have made the switch, have found that the old way of communicating and doing things can be transformed into something much better with <a title="Microsoft Lync Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a>. An example of one of these process transformations, one that our engineers are often asked about, is Microsoft Lync’s paging capabilities.

Many businesses migrating from an old PBX solution love their traditional paging systems. These systems work great for simple office announcements or to help locate users. But when we’re talking about the modern office environment and taking advantage of the latest technology and best of breed solutions, there are some issues with paging that don’t translate so well. A traditional paging system fails the modern office environment for many reasons – you can’t take it anywhere, the user has to be in the building for it to be effective, they tend to lock businesses into a platform and it’s basically becoming redundant in today’s mobile office.

Can a business have the modern office experience and keep their paging system too? The answer is yes! While it’s true that Microsoft did not include native support for paging in Lync as it translates to legacy systems, there is third party hardware that connects directly into Lync, or can connect to a universal paging system with an analog port. These Lync certified devices allow us to plug into outdoor intercoms, keypad intercoms and overhead ceiling speakers.

But – there are also many different process transforming scenarios that will arise with the whole new world of capabilities that Microsoft Unified Communications brings to a business, which makes the notion of paging users seem a little antiquated. Why page a user’s phone when you can send a quick IM, or page a user to see if they are available when you can quickly see their status through Microsoft Lync’s presence indicator? Not only are we able to reach out to users who are in the office, mobile clients also allow us to communicate and check presence for our out-of-office users with the same ease. It’s as if the end user was working near our desk. When we look at the possibilities of Microsoft Lync and Unified Communications, we find that some of the old ways of doing things like audible paging fade away with new simpler methods of locating people.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Football season is finally underway, which is always a fun and exciting time for me, as friends and family gather together to watch the game. Many of them are cheering for their favorite teams, but some of them are rooting for the players that comprise their fantasy football teams. This got me thinking about IT and SWC’s midmarket clients. If they had the ability to pick a fantasy <a title="Chicago Managed IT Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">IT team</a>, who should be on it?

Depending on the size of the company, I think you would need at least three types of resources:
<h2>CIO</h2>
This person would have a broad understanding of technology and how technology can be used to improve the business, whether it’s being more competitive or setting up a foundation that will allow the company to grow, or putting the tools and resources in front of employees to allow them to do their jobs more effectively and deliver better service for their clients. This person definitely has a technology background, but a business focus – you need that person to be able to connect the two. Either one of them working independently is a recipe for disaster.
<h2>Engineer</h2>
The engineer is important because you need somebody to execute the plan. The CIO is going to come up with the strategic plan in working with the business and the engineer is going to execute that. The perfect engineer is someone who has all of the depth and breadth of experience that you need across a wide range of technologies that are very apparent in today’s businesses. Those people are hard to find, but would probably be at the top of my list!
<h2>IT Delivery/Support</h2>
This is someone who is delivering support to the end users. Someone who is really focused on customer service has a good technology background. They are very focused on problem solving and being tenacious and delivering that service, so that the users can effectively engage in technology to do their jobs better…we all know happy employees make the business more money.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of ‘Ask SWC,’ we discuss Connections 2013, ExactTarget’s recent digital marketing conference in Indianapolis, IN. Watch our video to learn more about this exciting event, SWC’s partnership with ExactTarget and what it has to offer digital marketers.

<a title="ExactTarget's Exciting Offerings for Marketers" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/z6YBoCCg0CA?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>

ExactTarget is a cloud based, on-demand email marketing and digital communication platform SWC has helped customers integrate into their <a title="Salesforce.com CRM" href="/solutions/crm/salesforce-com-customer-relationship-management">Salesforce CRM</a> systems. The recent ExactTarget user’s event, Connections 2013 was a very impressive week full of education and inspiration focused on energizing marketers and industry experts to “lead from within.” Now that I am back from the conference, I’m still excited and enthusiastic about the product and it’s been a while since I’ve been to a conference and felt like that. You can just feel when you are with a company and they are at a special place, right now ExactTarget is a special company in a special place.

ExactTarget was recently acquired by Salesforce, the world’s number one sales, service and marketing app. The company will still, however maintain their autonomy and independence. They have a very clear mission in terms of what they are doing in the digital world and digital marketing place. I really think they have their act together and it’s just one of those things where I walked away from the conference thinking that this company is in that golden triangle right now.

Over the next couple weeks I am going to be spending some time wrapping my arms around the new announcements and enhancements ExactTarget is making to their platform, so stay tuned for those. Specifically the enhancements around predictive analytics and what it means to digital marketers. They have something new called Journey Builder, a cloud based lifecycle marketing application that delivers personalized customer experiences to large scale audiences. If you’re a marketing geek like me, it’s very exciting – technology finally catching up with the vision that all of us have had for some time.

If you want to learn more about ExactTarget, please join us for our next Mastering Digital Marketing through <a title="Chicago Salesforce.com Event" href="/events">Salesforce event</a>.

		<title>Ask SWC: What is User Enablement Training?</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/ask-swc/what-is-user-enablement-training</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Customer or user enablement training is a really important element of any technology implementation. This is often overlooked by customers and something most consulting firms don’t offer. Instead of just putting a technology solution in place and hoping the investment pays off, SWC offers user enablement training to ensure our customers are finding success and user adoption with the new technology solutions we implement. Watch this week’s episode of ‘Ask SWC’ to learn more about how user enablement training can benefit your organization and sets SWC apart from the competition.

<a title="SWC's User Enablement Training" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EnKizRWbbj8?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>

Customer enablement is a really important element in any technology implementation, whether it’s <a title="Microsoft Business Intelligence" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Microsoft Business Intelligence</a>, <a title="Microsoft CRM Consulting" href="/solutions/crm">CRM</a>, <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Consulting" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a>, <a title="Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications</a> or any other technology solution. At SWC we actually offer this as a benefit to our customers through our consulting services, which is something unusual that we’ve found most consulting firms don’t do. Instead of just putting a solution in place and hoping the investment pays off, SWC adds that “extra bonus” of communication planning, training planning and user adoption planning. We roll all of this into a service or term we call user enablement training.

The first step is communication planning and it is really critical to the success of any project. Most customers actually forget about this step and then, once the solution is rolled out to their users, they wish they would have provided more information or communication at the beginning of the project to ensure its success and user adoption. At SWC, we try to get our customers thinking about this early on in the project, so that we can get users excited about the new technology investment the organization is making and ensure it will be adopted. SWC’s years of experience creating communication planning and user enablement programs, ensures our customer’s communication plans are written well and designed properly.

Once the solution has been deployed and put in place, we begin our user enablement training program, so that the customer and users actually know how to use the solution, further making sure the technology investment pays off. Our solution takes a technology project from just a check list of – “Yes, we implemented this solution for our users,” to a really great check list of – “Yes, we put this technology in place and our users actually using it and being more productive and finding success with it.”

By engaging SWC in customer or user enablement training an organization will receive communication planning upfront, an end user training program that might go on after the solution has been put in place and then finally our best practices for basic user adoption programs and a proven methodology on how to get your users excited about the solution. We want users to want to use it and feel like the organization has given them a new solution to enable them to do their jobs better.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't typically write blogs that reference other blogs, but one of the traditional fears around Lync as a PBX replacement is that it's too new or not mature enough. Those fears have mostly dissolved as Lync has proven itself repeatedly in the last few years in organizations of all sizes (and all sizes deployed by SWC). Here is a recent blog written by the Microsoft Lync team that was too interesting not to share: <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/lync/archive/2013/10/21/lync-voice-leading-in-enterprise-shipments.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.technet.com/b/lync/archive/2013/10/21/lync-voice-leading-in-enterprise-shipments.aspx</a>.

We all know that Microsoft Lync's market share may seem small compared to some of the tenured telephony giants, but its growing fast. In fact, <a title="Microsoft Lync Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> is growing faster in the enterprise voice space than any other technology company in the world. Here are some stats on this from Microsoft:
<ul>
	<li>In 2013, almost 60% of enterprises (500+ seats) have deployed or plan to deploy <a title="Unified Communications Microsoft Lync" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Lync</a>, including enterprise voice, this is up from 45% last year</li>
	<li>The proportion of enterprises with no plans to deploy Microsoft Lync for voice has dropped dramatically, from 21% down to only 7%</li>
	<li>One in four enterprises report Microsoft as their preferred vendor for IP-PBXs, this was unheard of in 2010</li>
</ul>
These stats are really exciting! For those of you unsure where Lync fits, or if it's mature enough to be your PBX platform, rest assured that not only are SWC's clients in love with it, but so is everyone else. It's a very exciting time and we're here to help!

		<title>Ask SWC: What Is The SharePoint Envisioning Process?</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/ask-swc/what-is-the-sharepoint-envisioning-process</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of ‘Ask SWC,’ our <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Solutions" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint Solutions</a> leader, Jeff Lanham discusses the SWC SharePoint Envisioning Process and how it’s helping customers create SharePoint solutions that are easy to use, engaging and increase user adoption. Watch our video to learn more.

<a title="SWC's SharePoint Envisioning Process" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OG_k9JIOaAY?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>

As more organizations have implemented <a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-2013">Microsoft SharePoint</a>, their internal skills and capabilities have grown. As a SharePoint consulting partner, SWC has always tried to look for areas where we can really provide unique value and extend the capabilities of our clients as they are looking to implement SharePoint. One of the ways we do this is through our proprietary <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Envisioning Process" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint/sharepoint-envisioning-process">SharePoint envisioning process</a>.

Our approach has been honed over the course of more than ten years of experience with Microsoft SharePoint and literally hundreds of implementations. In that time, we have found that an envisioning and design process at the beginning of a project can be a great way to help key stakeholders understand what the platform is capable of and how to get the most out of SharePoint from a business value prospective.

From there we proceed to craft several design concepts that run the spectrum from conservative and more traditional to a little more progressive and perhaps more visually exciting. We then work with the stakeholders to refine those designs into a final creative look and feel and also focus on building out the navigation structure and layout of the rest of the environment.

One of the best things about this approach is that it’s flexible and can scale to any size organization, sector or vertical. We’ve found it’s important to focus on the envisioning and design concept in the beginning of a SharePoint implementation, because a little bit goes a long way towards ultimately creating a more compelling initial experience for users that drives adoption and value.

To view some great examples on how SWC can give your SharePoint environment a fresh look and feel while focusing on usability, check out our SharePoint design portfolio at: <a title="SharePoint Portfolio" href="http://www.swc.com/design-portfolio/sharepoint" target="_blank">SWC.com/design-portfolio/SharePoint</a>

		<title>How Do I Connect It To Microsoft Lync?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re considering moving to <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> as your <a title="Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications solution</a>, there is still a dependency on analog and legacy telephony devices such as common area phones, door phones, elevator lines or overhead paging. Such devices must work with Microsoft Lync endpoints if you want to ensure a successful PBX replacement. SWC has found that solutions provided by vendors such as AudioCodes or SNOM can help.

In order to interface with analog devices, Microsoft Lync needs to have a way to convert its SIP-based signaling and voice streams into a standard phone line. Devices called Media Gateways can accomplish that. Let's take the example of a door phone and how it would integrate into Microsoft Lync:
<ul>
	<li>The door phone connects to Media Gateway via an analog line</li>
	<li>When a caller presses the Call button on the door phone, the line goes off-hook</li>
	<li>The Media Gateway auto-dials the Lync Response Group (perhaps a receptionist) upon the line going off-hook</li>
	<li>The Lync user or group rings, answers and proceeds to talk</li>
	<li>The Lync user may trigger a door entry relay by passing DTMF tones when pressing # or *</li>
</ul>
A similar scenario would be used for phones used in elevators or analog common areas like warehouse service phones or emergency phones that can automatically dial 911.

Additionally, these Media Gateways are the interface that enables Lync to talk to legacy PBX systems, which helps in the case of a phased migration. Media Gateways can also be used to have a pool of Fax machines receive faxes through an all-digital SIP trunk or T1 line. Regardless of the scenario, having a Media Gateway as part of your Lync infrastructure enables flexibility and further extends Microsoft Lync's capacity to function as your business’ Unified Communications platform.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[April 8, 2014. What does this mean? To most people nothing. But to anyone in IT, they know it as the day Microsoft ends support for Window XP or anyone using Office 2003. Watch our recent episode of ‘Ask SWC’ to learn more about how we are helping our clients prepare for <a title="Windows XP End Of Life" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/april-2014-windows-xp-support-ends">Windows XP End of Life</a>.

<a title="Windows XP End of Life" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/GsOTNVx4Fyk?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>

At SWC, a lot of our clients are still using Windows XP and Office 2003 and many of them do not have a plan to get off these platforms. We’ve worked with a lot of our clients to not just talk about a PC refresh, but also build a deployment strategy and plan for migrating from <a title="Microsoft Windows Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</a> XP to <a title="Microsoft Windows 7 Consulting" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-7">Windows 7</a> or 8. We want to make sure that we are providing more than just the next generation of operating systems; we want to provide a plan that enhances the organization and provides a seamless transition for users.

If your business operates on Windows XP, SWC offers desktop deployment assessments to help prepare for Windows XP’s end-of-life. We have developed a proven methodology that allows us to identify where your organization’s vulnerabilities are and assist you with choosing the right desktop operating system to support your technical landscape and meet business objectives. Whether it’s Windows 7, <a title="Microsoft Windows 8 Consulting" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/windows-8">Windows 8</a>, virtualization, the cloud, mobile, or a hybrid approach, we’ll help you make sense of it all and choose the right platform or combination of platforms for your business.

		<title>BYOD Policies And Mobile Device Management</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bring your own device (BYOD) is the emerging trend of enabling employees to bring personally owned mobile devices, most commonly tablets and phones to use in the workplace. However, BYOD can cause some serious security risks for companies. In this <a title="Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services">Managed Services</a> blog, we will explore how an organization can get the most out of BYOD while reducing risk and cost.

With the rise in popularity of BYOD, one of the scariest things a business faces is allowing an employee’s personal devices to access to proprietary company data or records that contain customer’s personally identifiable information. A recent report, “<a href="http://www.ciscomcon.com/sw/swchannel/registration/internet/registration.cfm?SWAPPID=91&amp;RegPageID=350200&amp;SWTHEMEID=12949" target="_blank">BYOD Insights 2013: A Cisco Partner Network Study</a>,” found that 90 percent of employees are bringing their own smartphones to work but 40 percent of those phones were not password protected. In addition to these security risks, a BYOD policy can increase the demand of an organization’s IT staff to assist employees with getting their personal devices on the corporate network and enabling e-mail and calendar sync.

A BYOD policy and Mobile Device Management solution will allow companies to get the most out of BYOD while reducing the risk and cost. A Mobile Device Management suite allows the IT department to:
<ul>
	<li>Secure employee devices – both by enforcing password policies and enabling them to remotely wipe a device if it gets lost or stolen</li>
	<li>Manage the device – send encryption keys to the device for wireless networks or configuration settings for e-mail push</li>
</ul>
To learn more about creating and implementing an effective BYDO policy and Mobile Device Management, please join us for our next informative <a title="Chicago Managed Services Events" href="/events">Managed Services event</a>.

<a title="Cool Feature of Microsoft Lync" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RbTrj0yrZ-c?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>

With Microsoft Lync you don’t have to schedule the conference ahead of time to get a little more privacy when you are on a call. All you have to do is walk over to the conference room and if it has a Lync phone, just search for the phone in the contacts area of your Lync menu and transfer the call. It’s fast, easy and will save you time. And the best part is – if you have a <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications</a> solution, the conference is free! Microsoft Lync 2013 is easy to use and its intuitive user experience continues to make the platform a compelling telephony solution for all of your organization’s instant messaging, presence, conferencing and voice needs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><em>Have you recently encountered the MSSQL 18456 Event?</em></strong> I’ve seen this come up in quite a few migrations after <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync 2013</a> is installed and pools are paired. Since I couldn’t find much about MSSQL 18456 on the internet, I thought I would share my findings for everyone else who has experienced an endless number of MSSQL 18456 information events.

Once you encounter the MSSQL 18456 information event, fill the application event log with the message: “Login failed for user 'DOMAIN\SQLSERVERNAME$'. Reason: Failed to open the explicitly specified database 'xds'. [CLIENT: IP Address]”. This issue can occur if the Lync 2013 pools were set up and paired first, and the CMS moved later to one of the pools. If you see the message above related to your backup pool, the simplest thing you can do is remove the pairing from the topology, publish, then reestablish the pairing and republish. Another alternative is to create the database via the PowerShell using this command: Install-CsDatabase -CentralManagementDatabase -SQLServerFQDN-SQLInstanceName.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of ‘Ask SWC,’ our CRM Solutions leader, Elliott Baretz discusses his thoughts on Dreamforce 2013. Dreamforce is Salesforce’s annual user and developer conference. Watch our video to learn more about the biggest cloud computing event of the year and SWC’s partnership with <a title="Salesforce.com Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm/salesforce-com-customer-relationship-management">Salesforce</a>.
<a title="Thoughts on Dreamforce 2013" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4U0YriJ7rVk?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>
Salesforce is a cloud based <a title="Customer Relationship Management Services" href="/solutions/crm">Customer Relationship Management</a> (CRM) solution that helps companies sell, service, market and succeed by giving them the ability to connect with customers and close deals faster. Dreamforce 2013 drew over 100,000 people this year, increasing San Francisco’s population by 15% – which was pretty amazing. I wanted to take this blog as an opportunity to share some of the information I learned at the event and some of the things that I found interesting and am excited about.

The first thing is Pardot, a marketing automation platform that helps bridge the gap between sales and marketing through powerful and targeted email campaigns that simplify lead generation and management. The tool’s ability to do Business to Business (B2B) marketing, scripting and automate B2B initiatives based on actions and scoring for prospects is very interesting.

Next is Journey Builder, an application that provides real-time automated and personalized customer campaigns to large scale audiences. As part of the ExactTarget suite, Journey Builder’s ability to leverage Salesforce to put together very sophisticated and elaborate marketing campaigns based on actions and sequences is quite impressive. One of the examples from the conference was how Ford leverages the product. When a vehicle owner hits a certain mileage, the platform alerts ExactTarget, which then triggers an email to the owner about maintenance or services that should be scheduled at that time. This is a great example of a cross sell or upsell.

It was also very exciting to learn more about the social media aspects of ExactTarget, Radian6 and Buddy Media. These are some tremendous platforms and great products that integrate into Salesforce for state-of-the-art reporting and analytic capabilities.

If you want to learn more about Salesforce or ExactTarget, please join us for our next Mastering Digital Marketing through <a title="Chicago Salesforce.com Event" href="/events">Salesforce event</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of our favorite Business Intelligence tools at SWC is <a title="Tableau Solutions" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/tableau">Tableau</a>. Our customers really love it because it’s mobile and puts the power of data analytics in anyone’s hands. Watch our recent episode of “Ask SWC” to learn more about our favorite features of Tableau.
<a title="Take Charge of Data with Tableau" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ct8UgeifMew?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>
Tableau is a highly intuitive and visually rich <a title="Business Intelligence Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a> application that can connect to a variety of <a title="Cloud Solutions" href="/solutions/cloud-services">cloud</a> and native data sources, including Salesforce.com and Google Analytics. By using a data buddy, you can combine all of these data sources into one dashboard by simply dragging and dropping the data in. Tableau’s user-friendly interface provides even the non-technical user with the ability to quickly analyze this data to instantly create visually rich, powerful and interactive dashboards.

Tableau’s recent release, Tableau 8 has offered users a lot of great updates including report subscriptions, one-step forecasting, JavaScript API and a mobile app. The mobile app is by far one of my favorite features, because it allows you to view all of your reports in real-time. You can also use almost all of the same features you would on your desktop version using the mobile app, including zooming, filtering and highlighting. You can even edit reports in real-time from your mobile app!

To learn more about BI and all of the exciting new features Tableau 8 has for the business intelligence community; please join us for our next informative <a title="Chicago Business Intelligence Event" href="/events">Business Intelligence event</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In popular culture the Chupacabra is an almost mythical creature sighted many times in the Americas but has never been confirmed as an actual member of our fauna. Many have sighted, photographed, or even dreamed about the Chupacabra, but we still don’t have any proof that this creature really exists or what it is. In regards to social media, many of us have amassed large amounts of raw textual data and so little has been done thus far to gain insight from it. Many of us have a desire to use business intelligence to analyze social media text to get accurate insights. Decision makers want to ask questions like, “What is my product or company’s social media sentiment?” So how do we measure and score sentiment? How do we separate fact from fiction or truth from sarcasm in an aggregate form? Thus we have a digital “Chupacabra” aptly named “Sentiment Scoring” or “Social Media Sentiment Score.” When you look at all the raw data, it just seems like a cruel riddle wrapped in an enigma of digital noise! But we know there is value to be had.
<h2>So How Did We Get Here?</h2>
A few months back I was looking at doing a complete refresh of SWC’s <a title="Business Intelligence Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence</a> demo environment. We use this environment to showcase BI tools and architecture to our customers and prospects. It was time to start over and go beyond rebranding the same old tired BI use cases we had grown all too comfortable showing in the past. There’s only so much you can do with a generic general ledger cube demo or Bike Sales data mining model. It was time to break out of the traditional BI mold and do something fun and insightful that has a message any analytics hungry BI prospect could get excited about. And so we invented “Hyena Power.” Hyena Power Inc. or HPI is a fictitious manufacturer of home hydrogen generators that consumers use to produce hydrogen for fueling cars, water heaters, home generators and the like. Fun concept right? We’ve had a lot of fun inventing this company and sometimes I’m almost bummed our product is fake, but boy does it make for a really interesting BI Technology demo. So HPI is a new company with a great product and a hunger to grow their customer base in orders of magnitude so that GE buys them out in a leveraged buyout. HPI has a very diverse marketing engine combining Social Media, Search, Online Webinars, call center and seminars/luncheons. On the social media landscape HPI uses Yammer. The Yammer feed is where the sentiment requirement comes into play. For our demo environment, we chose Yammer as a way to simulate what a real Facebook or <a title="SWC LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/swc-technology-partners" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> feed might look like and how that data might be scored. So Yammer is a good alternative for Social Media prototyping and is similar to what we would actually do for a real company on <a title="SWC Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/SWCTechnologyPartners" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. Our goal at the outset of this demo exercise was to determine if we could put the Yammer data though a scoring algorithm and get insight into how our message is being perceived in the marketplace.
<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10894" title="SWC Chad Dotzenrod Putting It All Together" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-chad-dotzenrod-putting-it-all-together-300x236.jpg" alt="SWC Chad Dotzenrod Putting It All Together" width="300" height="236" />

Before we get into the scoring, I thought I’d show you what we are trying to do from the visualization side. In the dashboard above, what we’re trying to do is provide visualization to the all the wonderful data we’re collecting from Yammer and various systems. On the bottom right, we have a heat map that shows a set of popular bloggers for HPI and what their sentiment scoring looks like in aggregate. In this chart red is bad (neutral or negative scores). At the top there is a very simple line chart over calendar weeks showing the count of positive, negative and neutral social media updates. What was interesting here is that HPI made a conscious effort to reduce neutral content and drive more positive scores and we see that correlation nicely. Finally, on the bottom left we used a packed bubble to visualize all of HPIs marketing efforts, including but not limited to social media.
<h2>How Did We Do It?</h2>
I wish I could tell you that we mastered the challenges of machine learning. But, we did not! However, we learned a lot from this project and got some great insights that helped us to build the 1.0 version rather quickly.
After spending several evenings on my tablet trying to educate myself on the concept of social media scoring, it became abundantly clear that I was way out of my pay grade and really should have taken more math when I was getting my undergrad at North Dakota State University (Go Bison!). So I was kind of stuck, but then I remembered my brother, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/kevin-dotzenrod/1/1a4/793" target="_blank">Kevin Dotzenrod</a> works for Rupert Murdoch. Ok, he doesn’t directly report to him but he has met him a few times at work functions. So my brother Kevin has a colleague at Dow Jones, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/doug-esanbock/0/711/107" target="_blank">Douglas Esanbock</a> who is their resident expert on sentiment scoring pertaining to news stories and all things social media. Doug and I traded a few emails and got on the phone to discuss the concept. What we arrived at was something very similar to <a href="http://sentiwordnet.isti.cnr.it/" target="_blank">SentiWordNet</a> research.
Essentially the scoring works like the following:
<ul>
	<li>Build vectors of positive words and negative words</li>
	<li>Cleanse your social media input and remove non-word characters and punctuation</li>
	<li>Parse the social media update into a list and score each word against the vectors</li>
	<li>Calculate a score of the matching results whereas a high number would be positive sentiment, a negative score would be negative sentiment and somewhere in-between would be neutral</li>
</ul>
I know some of you gearheads want more and I aim to please, so here’s a snippet of code in “R” that we used for the scoring. I will point that that much of the this code was inspired by <a href="http://jeffreybreen.wordpress.com/2011/07/04/twitter-text-mining-r-slides/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Breen</a>
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-10895" title="SWC Chad Dotzenrod Snippet Of Code" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-chad-dotzenrod-snippet-of-code-262x300.jpg" alt="SWC Chad Dotzenrod Snippet Of Code" width="262" height="300" />
After playing with R and then getting serious about building the ETL prototype in SSIS we decided to forego R for the time being and use C# in an SSIS Script Data Flow component. That of which will be an upcoming blog topic we dig into deeper next month, when one of my colleagues, Patricia Motta, will tell us about her prototype scoring SSIS package. Until then, Happy Holidays!

		<title>CryptoLocker Virus Tips – Take Action Now!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been three months since the Trojan horse malware CryptoLocker first appeared. The timing was no accident – you get an e-mail that appears to come from shipping carriers like FedEx and UPS just as holidays shopping season begins to ramp up, but once you click on the link to track the package – you’re infected. But is it still dangerous? The answer is: Absolutely!

The CryptoLocker virus relies on an advanced network of command-and-control servers and continues to be developed by the malware’s creators. If you have not heard about CryptoLocker, it is a very nasty virus which encrypts your computer files and holds them for ransom. The virus demands that users pay anywhere from $300 to thousands of dollars to get their files back. Unfortunately, this virus has been very successful in extorting money from its victims which has motivated hackers to keep on developing more viruses.

Each new iteration of CryptoLocker becomes harder and harder to detect and antivirus vendors are struggling to keep up. But – if your organization cannot rely on your antivirus software, what else can you do? Here’s a list of four things SWC recommends:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Educate users</strong> – Do not open unsolicited attachments, no matter how legitimate they may appear. If you were not expecting it don’t open it! If a user does get a suspicious looking attachment they should contact IT or <a title="Managed IT Help Desk Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-help-desk-service-desk-services">Help Desk</a> immediately.<strong></strong></li>
	<li><strong>Regular backups</strong> – Use a combination of volume shadow copy (previous versions) and offline backups. If users are still storing files on their local computers, you should look into folder redirection using domain-based group policy.<strong></strong></li>
	<li><strong>Keep your operating system and software up-to-date</strong> – If your organization is still running Windows XP and migration has not already begun, it’s time to get serious about making the move. With less than five months remaining before <a title="Microsoft Windows XP End Of Life" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/april-2014-windows-xp-support-ends">Microsoft will stop supporting Windows XP</a>, there is very little time left to develop a plan and begin testing applications; however upgrading should be any IT department’s number one priority going into 2014. Once XP is out of the way, your IT team can focus on keeping common applications and runtimes like Acrobat, Flash and Java up-to-date and deploying monthly security patches from Microsoft to workstations using Windows Server Update Services.<strong></strong></li>
	<li><strong>Revise IT policies to protect users from themselves</strong> – Users should not be logging into computers as local administrators. Use software restriction policies to protect against unauthorized software, especially in temporary folders and removable drives. Block executable files at your spam filter before the user ever receives it.</li>
</ul>

		<title>OAuth 2.0 – Google API Business Intelligence Implementation</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/business-intelligence/oauth-2-0-google-api-bi-implementation</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2013 13:50:27 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently had the pleasure of working with OAuth 2.0 in tandem with Google API’s for one of my clients and thought I would share my experience with all of you today.
<h2>What is OAuth 2.0?</h2>
OAuth 2.0 is an open industry standard and framework that provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner by means of authentication from the resource owner with approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing third-party applications to gain access on its own behalf. OAuth 2.0 can provide a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials (typically, a username and password pair).
<h2>That’s great and all, but what does OAuth 2.0 have to do with my BI Solution?</h2>
OAuth 2.0 is being used to obtain massive amounts of data on a daily basis from many different sources (RSS/ATOM feeds, Google Analytics, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Facebook, Twitter and the list goes on…).
<h2>How Does the Authentication Process Work?</h2>
There are a few different methodologies for how authentication can be obtained (Web Server Applications, Installed Applications, Client-Side Applications and Service Accounts) and you just have to decide which way works best for your use-case/application.
<h2>Web Server Applications via Google API</h2>
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10909" title="OAuth 2.0 Photo 1" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/oauth-2-photo-1-150x150.jpg" alt="OAuth 2.0 Photo 1" width="150" height="150" />The authorization sequence begins when your application redirects a browser to a URL. The URL includes query parameters that indicate the type of access being requested. Google handles the user authentication, session selection and user consent. The result is an authorization code, which the application can exchange for an access token and refresh token. The application should store the refresh token for future use and use the access token to access an API. Once the access token expires, the application uses the refresh token to obtain a new one.
<h2>Installed Applications via Google API</h2>
The Google OAuth 2.0 endpoint supports applications that are installed on devices such as computers, mobile devices and tablets. When you register an application through the Google Cloud Console, you can select Android, iOS, Chrome or native as the platform. The registration process will result in a client ID and in some cases, a client secret which you embed in the source code of your application. The authorization sequence is obtained the exact same way as it is in the above mentioned Web Server Applications via Google API.
<h2>Client-Side (JavaScript) Applications via Google API</h2>
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10910" title="OAuth 2.0 Photo 2" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/oauth-2-photo-2-150x150.jpg" alt="OAuth 2.0 Photo 2" width="150" height="150" />The Google OAuth 2.0 endpoint supports JavaScript applications that run in a browser. The authorization sequence beings when your application redirects a browser to a URL. The URL includes query parameters that indicate the type of access being requested. Google handles the user authentication, session selection and user consent. The result is an access token, which the client should validate before including it in a Google API request. When the token expires, the application repeats the process.
<h2>Service Accounts Applications via Google API</h2>
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-10911" title="OAuth 2.0 Photo 3" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/oauth-2-photo-3-150x150.jpg" alt="OAuth 2.0 Photo 3" width="150" height="150" />Google API’s can act on behalf of an application without accessing user specific information. When an application accesses these API’s the application needs to prove its own identity, but there is no need to gain a user’s approval. In enterprise scenarios, an application can request delegated access to some resources. Google’s OAuth 2.0 endpoint supports these type of server-to-server interactions which makes this the optimum choice for a Business Intelligence (BI) solution because we can use a script task and not require any user interaction to complete the authorization process. Once the service account is created, you have access to the private key and a client ID. You use the private key and client ID to create a signed JWT and construct an access-token request in the appropriate format. Your application then sends the token request to the Google OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server, which returns an access token. The application then uses the access token to gain access to a Google API. When the token expires (1 hour expiration time), the application should repeat the process.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the past, <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC has surveyed Mid-Market IT and business executives, hoping to gather valuable insights on the trends, tactics and technologies that are creating the most impact on their businesses. Watch our 2013 tech trends video to view the results of our most recent poll.
<a title="SWC Technology Partners 2013 Cloud Survey Summary" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EnfBs3qBJjM?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-tech-trends-survey-video.jpg" alt="SWC Technology Trends Survey" width="500" height="281" /></a>
<h2>Video Commentary &amp; Survey Results</h2>
Recently, we sent out a survey to Midwest, midmarket IT and business leaders and asked them how their organizations viewed the <a title="SWC Cloud Services" href="/solutions/cloud-services">Cloud</a>. It’s a topic that we’re all thinking about and trying to understand – how big this thing has become and we learned a few things.

Specifically, we asked, from a disaster recovery perspective – how many of you are using the cloud as an option and we learned that almost 10% of you are using it as a solution. Interesting enough, we learned that nearly 25% of you did not have a Disaster Recovery solution. This may be noteworthy as those folks move to implementing a Disaster Recovery solution; we may see the cloud number going up. Other findings included nearly 40% of you have your Disaster Recovery solution located in a dedicated <a title="Cloud Disaster Recovery Solutions" href="/solutions/cloud-services/recovery-cloud">Disaster Recovery</a> site and a little over 26% of you have it hosted with a third party provider.

The other question that we asked was relative to infrastructure – how many of you are leveraging the cloud to manage your infrastructure? What we found was that a little over 70% are still have their entire infrastructure on premise, with nearly 30% having some form of cloud based infrastructure, whether that’s private, public or in between.

Finally we asked how many of us are using the cloud to host, enable or manage applications and that number seems to be lower than the others, it’s about 13%. But these are massive implementations if we think about it – big enterprise applications that were built on-premise that have moved to a cloud based environment, such as Amazon or Azure.

As with all elements of the cloud we think that attrition plays a role, so as technologies become old and dated and investments need to be made, those investments will be made in the cloud. So today we have a number, but we think that number is going to grow into the cloud.

This poll has provided some interesting information that has to do with what’s going on today in our marketplace. If you have any thoughts in terms of what trends you would like us to talk about in our next poll, let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">info@swc.com</a>. We look forward to getting more results to you in the future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love this time of year. Sure, it can be filled with a lot of hustle and bustle, but it’s also a time where we reflect on what’s most important and spend time with those we care about. That’s why I wanted to share a cute video of the students from Alain Locke Charter School. They recently came to visit <a title="SWC Technology Partners" href="http://www.swc.com">SWC Technology Partners</a> this holiday season to sing carols and tour our office.

<a title="Chicago's Alain Locke Choir Visits SWC" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wR65FSNby6E?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/alain-locke-choir-video.jpg" alt="Chicago's Alain Locke Choir Visits SWC" width="500" height="281" /></a>

At SWC, we value community outreach, and that doesn’t just mean writing a check to some non-profit that we have no relationship with. Through SWC, our employees have built a strong kinship with the faculty, staff and students of Alain Locke Charter School, and throughout the year we participate in various functions with them, including Reading Angels and the Robotics Club. Alain Locke is making some great strides in closing the achievement gap to help students not only compete nationally, but globally and it’s incredible to be involved in their mission.

<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10939" title="alain-locke-swc-coat-drive" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/alain-locke-swc-coat-drive-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />

As the weather began to change, we learned about a need from our friends at Alain Locke. Many of the students were lacking proper outdoor attire for the impending winter. Can you imagine not having a warm coat in the midst of our treacherous Chicago winter? It’s one of the countless things I know I take for granted. So, as an organization, we decided to host a coat drive. Our employees pulled their resources and we were able to purchase a coat for every child that needed one. It was so exciting to see everyone pitch in and when we had collected all the coats, I was honored to be a part of the distribution. It’s a perfect reminder that technology succeeds with community.

As we near the end of the year, I’d like to wish you and yours a warm and safe holiday season.

		<title>Only 98 Days Left For Microsoft Windows XP!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Four years ago Microsoft announced that <a title="Microsoft Windows XP End Of Life" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/april-2014-windows-xp-support-ends">Windows XP had reached the end of its mainstream support</a> and that although they would continue to provide security updates every month through April of 2014, customers should begin migrating to newer versions of Windows. Time is quickly running out and in just 98 days Microsoft will cease providing those important security updates; leaving organizations holding the proverbial hot potato. Windows XP will not just be outdated – it will be a liability, permanently at risk: zero-day forever.

Without advanced exploit defenses found in newer operating systems, like UAC (User Account Control) and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), Windows XP was already affected by malware at a significantly higher rate, but malware is becoming more sophisticated and hackers increasingly patient. Security professionals believe that some hackers are already holding back discovered exploits, hoping that they go undiscovered and unpatched by Microsoft until the April deadline passes. Organizations can believe that their firewalls will block these threats but the reality is most intrusions begin as malicious websites or fraudulent e-mail attachments.

What is it, specifically, that is holding you, your department or your organization back? If you answered legacy applications then you are not alone. An independent survey by Avanade of 200 CIO’s and IT leaders revealed that 80% had concerns of unsupported Windows XP applications. But there is good news, SWC can help!

Talk to us about inventorying your organization. We can help you identify how many XP desktops are still in production with our <a title="Desktop Deployment Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/april-2014-windows-xp-support-ends">desktop deployment assessments</a>. SWC can help you discover which legacy applications are actually being used and how to begin compatibility testing. SWC can also help you virtualize those stubborn legacy applications that just refuse to work on newer operating systems.

		<title>If They Only Had Tableau</title>

		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.swc.com/?p=10988</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-10986" title="If They Only Had Tableu Photo 1" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/if-they-only-had-tableu-photo-1.jpg" alt="If They Only Had Tableu Photo 1" width="225" height="124" />I’m a car nut! Specifically, I’m in love with old classic cars from the 60’s. When I was nothing more than a twinkle in my Mother’s eye, my Dad was racing stock cars on dirt tracks in central MN in the late 60’s. My dad’s car was a late model Studebaker Hawk and he had a lot of fun with the hoppy. I sometimes wish we could see new chrome encrusted Studebakers coming out of South Bend IN again!

Which brings me to my next thought, “What if Studebaker and others had BI?” More specifically, what if they had <a title="Tableau 8 Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/tableau">Tableau</a>? Put aside the fact they would have needed a computer the size of my old high school to run Tableau in 1963 – but just imagine the possibilities! With that kid fantasy in mind, I put Studebaker and a few others back in business to present day. In the visualization, we have a dashboard of some classic bankrupt auto companies showing rate of return, dealer participation and product recalls (Sorry John Delorean – even in my fantasy world your cool stainless steel cars are crap!)
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10987" title="If They Only Had Tableu Photo 2" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/if-they-only-had-tableu-photo-2-300x253.jpg" alt="If They Only Had Tableu Photo 2" width="300" height="253" />
Click <a href="http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/BankruptCarCompanyRateofReturn/ClassicDash?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=no" target="_blank">here</a> to access Chad’s visualization from Tableau

What was particularly fun about this exercise was the compounding Rate or Return viz. As of this writing, Tableau doesn’t yet have a built in ROR function. However, you can roll your own with a little table function magic, which is exactly what I did here. So my data set had rate of return for each calendar year but didn’t have a compound rate for many years and you can’t just sum the aggregate of yearly RORs. You need a product of all the year members filtered by the end user. The ROR formula works like this: (Period1 +1)*(Period2+1)…* (Period last +1)-1. In Tableau, we can reproduce this function by using the PREVIOUS_VALUE function in a calculation like this: PREVIOUS_VALUE(1)*(1+SUM([ROR])) and then the cumulative function used in the visualization would be this: [ROR Product] -1.

So why should anyone care? First of all, you simply can’t put this logic in your data warehouse and calculate it ahead of time. You don’t know which time period(s) the analyst is going to start/end with. In a data warehouse, if you were going to pre-populate the cumulative ROR, it would have to be since inception date and that would make for some really un-usable charts and graphs. Care to see cumulative ROR since 1902 anyone? I thought not. So the cumulative ROR as well as a host of other financial calculations that are dependent on chosen time periods can take advantage of these table calculations in Tableau. Another benefit to keeping analytic calculations in Tableau is speed of delivery. We don’t have to go back to the data warehouse and refactor, we don’t have to re-extract the dataset, we can prototype, experiment, test and retest until we have it right – all from the Tableau client. In my sample, I used Tableau Desktop pro, but I could just as easily have used the free version of Tableau Public to do the same exact visualization. Tableau is an amazing piece of technology. I just wish Studebaker had it when they needed it most!

		<title>Ask SWC: What Are Some Cool New Features of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of “Ask SWC,” we’re taking a look at <a title="Microsoft Dynamics Customer Relationship Management" href="/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013</a>, also known as the Fall 2013 rollout. The new release has completely changed. If you have Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011, you will probably be in shock because it looks and behaves different than what you currently have now. Watch this episode of “Ask SWC” to see Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 in action!
<a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 Preview" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/f6YpiUfamZU?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>
Microsoft Dynamics is <a title="Customer Relationship Management Services" href="/solutions/crm">Customer Relationship Management</a> (CRM) system that automates business processes giving teams the tools to make quick and educated decisions about customers to drive sales and build relationships. In my video, I demoed some new features in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013, including:
<ul>
	<li>The Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 Dashboard look and feel.</li>
	<li>New icons that help illustrate actions, for examples – account add and case creation. In Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 everything has its own different icon, which helps to give a visual representation of what is going on.</li>
	<li>Top navigation with nifty little boxes that populate depending on where you are. For instance, when I go to the sales section, everything changes and it shows you related items, such as opportunities and so on.</li>
	<li>Another cool feature demoed and added to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 is a visual representation of your current view in the right column, depending on where you are in the system. You can show things like all active accounts listed by owner. This can be changed up and customized to show anything that you want. If you then switch views, it will update the graph, which is also a nice feature to have.</li>
	<li>I also like Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013’s new “Quick Create” feature. Unlike the past CRM version, you don’t have to do a lot of clicking around to create a new contact.</li>
	<li>In Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013, the idea of popups have completely gone out the window and everything is now an overlay, so you never have to leave your account view – and if you change your mind, you can easily click cancel. You do not have to go through multiple windows to get back to what you were doing, as you would have had to do in the past.</li>
	<li>The way that accounts and all records are displayed in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 has also changed. If you take a look, there is now Bing maps integration, so if you click on your account address, you can Bing map to where it is.</li>
	<li>Left navigation has also gone away in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013. The product has rolled everything up into one centralized view. Now all of my activities, posts, notes, contacts, opportunities and cases are listed right in front of me in one easy to use screen.</li>
	<li>Once again, I wanted to emphasize that the idea of popups are finally gone in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013. From my account view, I can easily create a new opportunity within an account by clicking on the plus sign, then a little pane overlays over the account and I can easily create an opportunity with the main focal points I want to capture.</li>
	<li>If I need more information on a contact or opportunity in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013, I can quickly click into that contact and you will notice there is a lot more information fills you can view or complete</li>
	<li>Another cool feature of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 is the pipeline. It really helps you focus in on what you need to be doing at a specific stage in the sales cycle – in this case an opportunity. In my demo, I was in the qualified stage of an opportunity and the system only shows me core fields that I need to update for this stage. If I were to press through to the pipeline stage, you will see that the fields I should be focusing on change. Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 helps to automate the process so that you can focus on the stages and things that are needed to do at that point in the sales cycle. You can now do you job more efficiently because there is no need to go through tons of forms or fields and determine what needs to be updated or entered for each.</li>
</ul>
I hope you enjoyed my brief demo on Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013. Everything demoed today can be customizable to meet your unique business needs and the things your company wants to capture. Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 is a very a robust system and complete overhaul from Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 and I could spend hours talking about all of the enhancements and changes that were made. Hopefully this video has given you a better sense of what is new and what you have to look forward to when you upgrade to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many times I’ve seen clients using <a title="Business Intelligence Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a> to satisfy individual ad hoc and corporate reporting needs. While this is one way to use BI, there is so much more you can do with the data and the solution. We sometimes get wrapped up in our day-to-day reporting needs and miss the bigger picture. That is, to recognize (and remember) that the data in the data warehouses contain the corporate experience and history of running the business. There is a wealth of information in there to help supply answers to questions like:
<ul>
	<li>Where is our business going?</li>
	<li>What are our top customers like?</li>
	<li>Who are our less profitable customers and what should we do about them?</li>
</ul>
And also –
<ul>
	<li>How can we better partner with our customers so that we both are more profitable?</li>
	<li>What tools and knowledge can we bring to the customer’s table to gain a competitive advantage over our competitors?</li>
</ul>
I’m currently working with a client to develop a very cool BI solution which will take their reporting to this next level – true analysis of their business experience. We are creating tools that can be used to create a win-win situation for them as well as their customers. For example, intelligence cubes or <a title="Tableau Solutions" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/tableau">Tableau</a> dashboards.

The client is a leading handler of fleet vehicles for their customers and we are beginning with the data collected over the years for accident claims, routine vehicle maintenance and vehicle sales. The company has been in business since the late 1940’s and there is a wealth of historical data available.

The key item in this business is the vehicle and one of the tools we are building is the ability to create vehicle profiles by any of the hundreds of attributes available. Based on historical experience, we will be able to create very detailed ways to look at a vehicle and on average, what happens to it over its lifetime.

The profiles will allow our client to better set their customer rates based on experience and also enables them to help their customers choose the right vehicles for their needs:
<ul>
	<li>What is the average total cost for a vehicle like this over its lifetime?</li>
	<li>What is the vehicle’s propensity to be in an accident in this geography?</li>
	<li>When is the best time to replace these vehicles?</li>
	<li>If the vehicle is needed for application X, would it be better to get vehicle A or vehicle B? Which has a lower cost of maintenance?</li>
	<li>What geographical area is better to finally sell a vehicle of this type to gain the highest return?</li>
</ul>
These are just a few of the questions and answers that give our client that edge – both internally and externally with their customers. Business Intelligence is fascinating and the possibilities are endless.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Unified Device Management is a buzz term we are hearing more and more these days due to the consumerization of mobile products and the gaining popularity and acceptance of <a title="Bring Your Own Device Policies" href="/blog/managed-services/byod-polices-mobile-device-management">Bring Your Own Device</a> (BYOD) policies in the workplace. Watch our recent episode of “Ask SWC” to learn more about our favorite Unified Device Management tools.
<a title="Unified Device Management" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Go0tIBFL2Ko?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>
BYOD is becoming more popular and common these days, as users want to choose the devices they work on inside and outside of the workplace. Traditionally this has presented a huge problem for IT departments in many organizations wanting to manage users’ devices in order to protect corporate data and applications and maintain security and compliance.

Unified Device Management is a great solution to both concerns and can be achieved by two Microsoft products – Windows Intune, a Mobile Device Management platform and <a title="Microsoft System Center Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center 2012</a> R2 Configuration Manager. System Center Configuration Manager helps IT keep maintain security policies, update software, monitor statuses and give users access to the applications they desire on the devices they choose. While Windows Intune provides a cloud based solution to enable remote users to use the devices they choose. We like these two products because they are seamlessly integrated, so if you have System Center Configuration Manager 2012 on your internal environment to manage all of your internal resources, we can simply integrate that into the recent version of Windows Intune, which will provide an extension to managing mobile devices, work group computers and even your user’s home computers, should you need to.

Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager and Windows Intune will provide your organization with a platform for very deep and robust management of all of the PCs and devices in your environment, whether they’re internal, external, company owned or personally owned.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was just starting my career at SWC back in the Winter of 2008 when I had an opportunity to visit Redmond and learn more about Microsoft BI and the new PerformancePoint product they were trying to get everyone excited about. It was a good event with lots of great presenters and topics. What was really interesting is that right before they escorted us off the campus, they gave us a sneak peak of their new Master Data Management product (MDS in a pre-beta state). While really sketchy on the details, <a href="http://donalddotfarmer.com/about-2/" target="_blank">Donald Farmer</a>, the godfather of Microsoft BI at the time promised this was going to be a big deal for Microsoft, BI and SQL Server when it launches!

Fast forward to present day – SQL 2012 has launched, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/solutions-technologies/enterprise-information-management/master-data-services.aspx" target="_blank">MDS</a> (Master Data Services) is in its second release, new features have been brought to bear like the Excel plug-in and a much more strategic licensing model was crafted to get better MDM market penetration. All good things for MDM and SQL Server! However, the MDS product is still new to a lot of people, very few books have been written about MDS and not enough community support exists organically to take this product to the next level.

I could go on and on about how Microsoft needs to do a better job of supporting their MDS product or I could just do something about it. Doing something about it is what we chose. So back in the tail end of 2013, a group of us at SWC set out to start a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Master-Data-Services-User-Group-Chicagoland/" target="_blank">Meetup</a> for MDS practitioners in the Chicago area. We called the group “Master Data Services – User Group – Chicagoland” and we invite anyone interested in MDS to attend whether they’re a DBA, BA, Architect or general user. The group has some simple goals: 1) Meet other MDM practitioners who share an interest in MDS 2) Learn new ideas, concepts, design patterns and best practices through our ongoing events 3) Support our members through professional collaboration. 4) Have fun and make new friends!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, one of SWC’s Engineers was featured on Telemundo’s national evening news broadcast to discuss recent events regarding the Target data breach and CEO’s apology. The infiltration affected millions of customers, as cyber hackers forced their way into Target’s system, gaining access to credit and debit card information. Click on the photo to watch the interview (in Spanish) or read the video transcription below.
<a href="http://www.telemundo.com/noticias/2014/01/13/director-de-target-ofrece-disculpas" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11170" title="Gonzalo Escarra SWC Technology Partners Telemundo Taping" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/gonzalo-escarra-swc-technology-partners-telemundo-taping.png" alt="Gonzalo Escarra SWC Technology Partners Telemundo Taping" width="560" height="340" /></a>
<h3>Telemundo English Translation –</h3>
<h2>“Director de Target Ofrece Disculpas” – “CEO of Target Offers Apology”</h2>
Maria Celeste Arrarás, Anchor: Executive Director of the Target Company spoke exclusively with our sister network, NBC, and apologized for the infiltration of dozens of customers who ended up in the hands of cyber hackers.

Jose Diaz-Balart, Anchor: Mari, just this weekend the department store chain Neiman Marcus announced that they were also victims of this crime. Janet Rodriguez with details.

<strong>[Filtration of Information]</strong>

Janet Rodriguez, Reporter: Yesenia Rangel said that a purchase at Target caused her a big headache.

<strong>[Yesenia Rangel was affected by the theft of information]</strong>

Yesenia Rangel, Interviewee: I was sent an email telling me that it was one of the cards found at Target.

Janet Rodriguez, Reporter: She and millions more were affected by information leakage occurred at the end of last year. Today for the first time, the person in charge of the company gave an apology.

<strong>[Gregg Steinhafel, CEO of Target]</strong>

Gregg Steinhafel, CEO: I am personally very sorry that this whole thing happened.

Janet Rodriguez, Reporter: He says he is personally sorry for what happened. The investigation into the theft of over 100 million customers’ credit and debit card information of Target continues.

Gregg Steinhafel, CEO: What we do know there was a malware installed on our….

Janet Rodriguez, Reporter: What is known now, says the Executive Director, is that the cash registers were infected with a cyber-virus is known as malware.

<strong>[Gonzalo Escarrá, SWC Technology Partners Engineer]</strong>

Gonzalo Escarrá, SWC Engineer: A program specifically designed to cause harm or spy system information.

Janet Rodriguez, Reporter: In a letter, Democrats in financial services committee of the lower house, called on Republicans to conduct a hearing in Congress about what happened to Target. Meanwhile, the luxurious department store, Neiman Marcus, has also announced that cyber pirates attacked their system. They have not revealed how many customers may have been affected.

Gonzalo Escarrá, SWC Engineer: When you have physical access to the cash register or computer systems, one can insert a device into the computer it infects.

Janet Rodriguez, Reporter: It would be surprising for many more to affirm allegedly being hacked. So far, Macy's and Wal-Mart companies have ensured that their customers do not have to worry about. Meanwhile, the CEO of Target says they have already removed malware from their cash registers and ensures implementation of a new technology to protect themselves from theft.

<strong>[Janet Rodriguez, Reporter – Chicago, IL]</strong>

Janet Rodriguez, Reporter: Some customers tell us they have now lost all confidence in Target after this incident and ensure that there will be no security measure that can be implemented to make them pay by card.

Yesenia Rangel, Interviewee: I no longer trust Target to buy with a card, anymore. No more.

Janet Rodriguez, Reporter: Many say not it’s not worth the uncertainty and will spare themselves by paying cash.

In Chicago, Janet Rodríguez, Telemundo

		<title>Microsoft SharePoint 2013 Demo To Go</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently had some techie fun putting together a self-contained <a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-2013">Microsoft SharePoint 2013</a> demonstration environment that I can run on my laptop in 32GB of RAM. It includes virtual machines running pfSense (a Linux-based router/firewall), Windows 2008R2 Active Directory Domain Controller, SQL Server 2012 Enterprise, SharePoint Server 2013 Enterprise, Lync Server 2013, Office Web Apps 2013 and <a title="Tableau 8 Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/tableau">Tableau Server 8</a>. While it's true I can't run them all at the same time, it's still amazing to me that I'm able to do it at all. This setup enables me to demonstrate the value of SharePoint, including its great integration with the rest of the major Microsoft products, all without the need for an internet connection or any other servers!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11233" title="Habiflex Homepage" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Habiflex1Homepage.png" alt="Habiflex Homepage" width="600" height="523" />
The core of the virtual demo environment is pfSense, Active Directory and SharePoint 2013 (with local SQL). These three VMs run very well in 16GB of RAM – once I 'warm up' the <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a> server by hitting some of the main pages, the response is quite good. In fact, it's faster than when I used to connect to a remote server at my office via the internet and DirectAccess. I'm sure it wouldn't stand up to a production scenario with multiple users, but it's great for demonstrations.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11234" title="Habiflex Leadership Site" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Habiflex2LeadershipSite.png" alt="Habiflex Leadership Site" width="600" height="549" />
I usually start up the Lync server as well, which needs 4GB of RAM. This enables the integration between SharePoint and <a title="Microsoft Lync Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Lync</a>. The most obvious manifestation is the 'presence indicator,' which is a little colored square that appears next to everyone's name, everywhere that names occur in SharePoint (or Office and other MS applications). The indicator turns green when the named person is logged in and available, yellow when they're offline and red when they're unavailable (like in a meeting or on a call). When you mouse-over the person's presence indicator, it pops up the 'people card.’ The 'people card' shows you relevant data about the person, including their picture, title, contact information and more. The 'people card' has buttons that allow you immediately start communicating with that person, via instant message (IM/chat), telephone, video, audio or web conference or email. In my demo, I'm actually able to mimic two people starting up a chat session, inviting others to participate, sharing desktops, and more.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11235" title="Habiflex Lync Practice Card" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Habiflex3LyncPracticeCard.png" alt="Habiflex Lync Practice Card" width="599" height="388" />
If the audience wants to see a demonstration of business intelligence solutions, I can turn off Lync and start up my BI demo server, which includes all of Microsoft SQL Server 2012's capabilities and Tableau Server 8. This VM needs 8GB RAM, and while it isn't the fastest, it's certainly adequate for a one user demo scenario. This allows me to show off various structured reporting scenarios with SQL Server Reporting Services. I can fire up Excel 2013, which is a great tool for exploring and analyzing OLAP cube-based data via PowerPivot or SQL Server Analysis Services. Excel tables, charts and graphs can then be displayed directly in SharePoint through Excel Services. I can demonstrate the types of scorecards and dashboards that can be built with SharePoint's PerformancePoint Services (PPS). I can compare and contrast PPS against Tableau, which is an increasingly popular third-party solution that provides some great data visualization capabilities, rendered inside SharePoint sites and pages.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11236" title="Habiflex Leadership Practice Dashboard" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Habiflex4LeadershipPracticeDashboard.png" alt="Habiflex Leadership Practice Dashboard" width="599" height="476" />
Finally, I can fire up my Office Web Applications virtual demo server (4 GB VM) and highlight its greatly improved capabilities for editing documents, spreadsheets, slide decks and notes directly inside a web browser. A nice side benefit to Office Web Apps is an improved experience when viewing search results in SharePoint 2013. When you mouse-over an Office file on the search results screen, it displays a popup window with an actual rendering of the file, so you can see what it looks like and make sure it's what you're looking for, before you open it.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11237" title="Habiflex Search Results" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Habiflex5SearchResults.png" alt="Habiflex Search Results" width="600" height="549" />
Altogether, it's been a fantastic experience for me to be able to present and demonstrate all the great capabilities and integration points of Microsoft's latest generation of technologies. It really helps my audience envision the value of the 'Microsoft Stack.' And, the best part is – it frees me from the pain and risk of needing an encrypted internet connection to remote servers, through spotty guest wireless routers!

		<title>Do Tableau And MDS Make Strange Bedfellows?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’ve ever spent time reading <a title="Tableau Solutions" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/tableau">Tableau</a> marketing material or went to a Tableau launch party you know that Tableau is all about ease of access to data! Nearly every data source you can think of has a native connector built right into the product. You’d be hard pressed to find a data source that Tableau isn’t able to integrate with either natively or via an ODBC driver. But there is a data problem that can’t be solved with another new connector. What’s a Tableau user to do if the data doesn’t exist, or a relationship is missing, or the data requires manipulation? You do have some fairly robust options within Tableau Desktop to make data corrections. Just last week I used that feature to fix some geography data right in Tableau Desktop. But what if those corrections need to get back to the source system? Or what if lots of users are fixing data quality right from Tableau? That’s certainly a data governance issue for many organizations to be concerned with don’t you think?
<h2>Enter SQL Server Master Data Services</h2>
Lately we seem to be finding lots of good use cases for our customers who are on <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL Server 2012</a> to leverage Master Data Services in many new and creative ways. What’s been particularly interesting is the usage of MDS to augment a Tableau project by providing those missing data sources or by enabling a missing relationship between multiple sources.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11257" title="Tableau Master Data Services Spreadsheet Snapshot" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/tableau-microsoft-data-services-spreadsheet-snapshot.png" alt="Tableau Master Data Services Spreadsheet Snapshot" width="600" height="211" />

So let’s talk about the missing data source problem first. Missing data is a classic <a title="Business Intelligence Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence</a> problem that needs to get solved. In the past, we would solve the missing data issue by creating a surrogate data source managed by some entity (user, team, or process). The data source oftentimes would be an Excel spreadsheet or in better situations, an actual table on SQL Server. The surrogate approach works functionally but there’s a huge downside due to the lack of process, governance, quality or all of the above. Now that Master Data Services has the Excel plugin, we can build models and entities to fill the missing data gap, users interact with the model via Excel, and business rules and MDS workflows ensure the quality of that data. In our BI demo environment at SWC, we use MDS to fill the data gap for campaign management. Our fictitious company didn’t have the money to pony up for a campaign management system so we built the campaign model in MDS. This approach works! If you were doing something like this in Excel or MS Access, you really need to think about a migration to MDS.

This leads me to the second problem we can solve for BI with MDS and that is the ability to manage and insert the missing relationships. Certainly there are plenty of examples where a savvy ETL developer can use logic to discover and infer the missing relationships in the data warehouse but there are situations where human intellect and decision making are necessary. If there are data sources you want to leverage in Tableau but lack the ability to blend them to the desired level of granularity, MDS could be the answer. On several projects we’ve wrestled with these data relationship problems and found the creation of a mapping entity in MDS was the cleanest, surest way to get the problem solved successfully.

Because we’re using MDS, not only do we benefit by having the missing relationship filled in but we also have a complete audit trail see what happened:
<ol>
	<li>Who setup the relationship?</li>
	<li>When was the relationship established?</li>
	<li>How many change iterations have occurred?</li>
	<li>Is the record valid based on business rules established by the business?</li>
</ol>
And there are many more benefits.

So back to Tableau. Many Tableau users love the ease of use of the tool and the ability to quickly bring ideas to life or answer questions with a compelling visualization. In situations where the data doesn’t exist, is incomplete, or is not blend-able via the Tableau data blending feature, we now have another data weapon at our disposal that can quickly be put into place to solve issues on the model side just like Tableau does on the visualization side.

<em>In this project (and in many others we have completed), the success of the Tableau dashboard we built was made possible by having a tool like Master Data Services to fill in some of the data gaps or incorrect data coming from source systems. In this demo we are using a fictitious company on Yammer to analyze data from social media using an algorithm to score social media updates as positive, negative or neutral. Using this tool, we can better understand the social sentiment of our product and company on various social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my favorite parts about working at <a title="Chicago IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">Chicago area IT consulting firm</a>, SWC is that they host a ton of awesome events and fun social gatherings. Watch my ‘Ask SWC’ video to learn more about the many benefits and fun events I enjoy working at SWC.
<a title="Best Part of Working at SWC" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1Y0e-m0f1wM?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>
SWC has an amazing corporate culture and one of the things I like the most about our culture is all of the great events we have. Some of my favorites are our Cubs outings, Whirlyball Tournaments, Pinstripes bowling and bocce ball events and the amazing holiday party we throw each year. The holiday party is s a great evening downtown that the whole company attends. There is always a band, tons of food and beverages and the company even provides a hotel room for each employee and their guest. It’s so much fun and one of the things I look forward to each year working at SWC.

SWC truly encourages employees to socialize by sponsoring a multitude of fun events. Social activities within the offices include frequently catered breakfasts and lunches, monthly birthday treats and various parties to further boost morale. Another unique event for the company is the ‘SWC Olympics’ a two-week battle that pits various teams against each other in friendly competition with ping pong battles, Wii tournaments, dodgeball, poker, talent competitions and myriad of other events. Additionally, every Friday at 4 PM work ceases so that employees can meet in the kitchen to socialize over beverages and snacks.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11327" title="Jeff Poling SWC Technology Partners" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jeff-poling-swc-technology-partners.jpg" alt="Jeff Poling SWC Technology Partners" width="563" height="145" />
Business and IT are in constant motion – application and device deployments, operating system upgrades and patch management are continual tasks for even the smallest IT shop. Not only are there tasks to accomplish, but the world of IT is changing rapidly. <a title="Microsoft Windows XP End Of Life" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/april-2014-windows-xp-support-ends">Windows XP is rapidly approaching its end-of-life</a>. Users are more mobile and take advantage of a variety of devices and applications. How can IT support this dynamic business environment?

<a title="Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/configuration-manager-sccm">Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2012</a> provides a comprehensive solution for addressing the needs of today’s IT organization. In a “single pane of glass,” applications and updates are distributed, operating systems are deployed, devices are managed and inventory is tracked.

Providing applications to business users when and how they need them is a critical part of IT’s role. With Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2012 R2, applications can be packaged in multiple ways, whether it’s traditional Windows Installer packages, App-V packages, or modern apps for Windows 8.1. Not only can applications be deployed in a variety of ways, but System Center Configuration Manager also provides the tools for putting applications directly in the hands of users. The Application Catalog provides a portal for users to obtain the software they need, when they need it. While enabling users’ access to applications, System Center Configuration Manager also provides IT the control needed to maintain the environment. Approvals can be set for applications so that compliance with licensing agreements is maintained. Critical security and other updates can be packaged and deployed as well. System Center Configuration Manager provides the ability to automate the process of downloading, packaging and deploying software updates using automatic deployment rules.

Windows XP is still a fixture in many environments. With the end-of-life for XP nearing, IT needs the tools to upgrade or migrate away from the old operating system. System Center Configuration Manager streamlines and simplifies the operating system deployment process using task sequences. In addition, it integrates with other tools from Microsoft such as the Windows Automated Deployment Kit (ADK) and Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT). IT can perform lite touch or zero touch deployments of modern operating systems as it seeks to fully move away from Windows XP.

Managing the proliferation of devices being used in the business environment is a critical part of IT’s role. System Center Configuration Manager can manage mobile devices using integration with <a title="Microsoft Exchange Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Microsoft Exchange</a> or using <a title="Cloud Solutions" href="/solutions/cloud-services">cloud</a> tools such as Windows Intune. In addition, cross-platform agents are available for Linux, UNIX and Mac. There also antivirus engines provided for across platforms. Using <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server</a> Reporting Services, System Center Configuration Manager can also provide detailed insight into devices and the environment through numerous out-of-the-box reports.

Whether it is application deployment, operating system upgrades or managing the variety of devices on today’s networks, System Center Configuration Manager provides IT the tools needed to manage an ever changing and evolving business environment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft recently released that they will be providing an extension of anti-malware for Windows XP until 2015. But what does this mean? Watch our latest “Ask SWC” video to learn more.

<a title="Microsoft's Windows XP Anti-Malware Extension" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pQH_zxyyQpQ?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Chicago IT Consulting Firm" width="474" height="262" /></a>

In the last few weeks there has been a lot of uproar about <a title="Microsoft Windows Consulting" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft</a> extending the anti-malware updates for Windows XP until 2015. But what a lot of people don’t realize is that this doesn’t really do a lot for us and there are still some glaring security holes for those running Windows XP, as operating systems won’t be patched. Microsoft will not extend any support to anyone on Windows XP. The 2015 anti-malware extension means Microsoft will only provide updates for Microsoft Security Essentials and virus definition updates will be offered for <a title="Microsoft System Center Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center</a> Endpoint Protection users.

The April 2014 deadline is still a crucial time, as Microsoft will only be giving antivirus protection through 2015 and no Windows XP security updates. A lot of our customers will continue to ask us how to get to Windows 7 or 8.1, and there are a lot of options SWC can offer around virtual desktops and virtual PC rollouts. If your business still operates on Windows XP, SWC offers <a title="Desktop Deployment Assessments" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/april-2014-windows-xp-support-ends">desktop deployment assessments</a> to prepare for Windows XP end of life. SWC’s proven methodology will help you identify where your vulnerabilities are and complete a seamless migration to the right desktop operating system for your business.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wanted to share a quick tip after moving the Central Management Store to a <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013 Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Lync 2013</a> pool. We’ve seen this many times over, after you’ve followed the instructions from Microsoft’s Technet article: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj688013.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj688013.aspx</a> and you’ve run get-csmanagementstorereplicationstatus. You either see nothing – emptiness, or all replication shows false. The simple solution is to ensure that you’ve followed all the steps and then check all of your Lync services to ensure they started. The biggest offenders are Lync Server File Transfer Agent and Lync Server Master Replicator Agent. Start those services up and you should be fine in a few minutes.

If you’d like assistance planning your path to <a title="Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Microsoft Unified Communications</a> please <a title="Contact SWC" href="/contact">contact SWC</a>, connect with <a title="Anthony Caragol LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anthony-caragol/6/48/488" target="_blank">Anthony Caragol on LinkedIn</a> or join us for our next <a title="Chicago Microsoft Lync Event" href="/events">Unified Communications event</a>.

		<title>Microsoft System Center Licensing Key Points</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The licensing model for <a title="Microsoft System Center Solutions" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center</a> has changed significantly from the previous release and this has resulted in some confusion and uncertainty when it comes to the current wave. Not to worry – SWC can help clarify what you need. In this blog post, we’ll give you the key decision points and requirements for System Center licensing.

In System Center 2007, there was no unified suite, thus each product had to be licensed individually. This meant purchasing <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server</a> instances, use-rights for each management server and Management Licenses (MLs) for each device.

But all this has been greatly simplified now in <a title="Microsoft System Center 2012 R2" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/microsoft-system-center-2012-r2">Microsoft System Center 2012 R2</a>. For starters, the whole suite is licensed together – you get all of the products! And, the rights to use Microsoft SQL Server 2012 are also included.

A standard license is ideal for a lightly virtualized private cloud and grants rights to two Operating System Environments (OSEs) per license. For highly virtualized environments, a datacenter license offers the same feature set with unlimited OSEs.

As with all of the Microsoft Windows products, CALs are required for each physical and virtual machine. For additional details on Microsoft System Center licensing and product information, please visit Microsoft’s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/licensing/about-licensing/SystemCenter2012.aspx#tab=4" target="_blank">FAQ</a> page or contact one of SWC’s Microsoft licensing specialists, to help you figure out the best way to deploy Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 in your organization.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone is talking about R these days and no, that doesn’t make them pirates! R is a popular (and free) statistical language for predictive analytics that can now be integrated into Tableau 8.1, one of our favorite <a title="Business Intelligence Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a> tools. Watch my recent episode of “Ask SWC” to learn more about R.
<a title="Tableau 8.1 and R" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zdDXdHxtevw?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Tableau 8.1 and R" width="474" height="262" /></a>
R is a popular statistical language if you haven’t heard of it before. A lot of people are now using it for predictive analytics and advanced statistical analysis for things like linear regression, advanced “what if” analysis, data mining and also sentiment analysis. It’s great for people trying to do predictive analysis or a lot of analytics on big data or large data sets efficiently and effectively. The other benefit is that it’s free – R is an open source software environment and programming language. One of the nice things about the open source community is that they are always collaborating and developing new features and functionality to publish back to the community.

So why are we talking more about R now? In the past R was typically used by data scientists and people that were very technical. But now that R has been integrated with <a title="Tableau 8 Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/tableau-8">Tableau 8.1</a>, R features and functionality have greatly enhanced Tableau’s past predictive modeling type capabilities for trending and forecasting. Those functions and models can be used in Tableau by creating different types of calculated fields that dynamically evoke the R engine, passing the values to R and then R passes the values back to Tableau to produce great visualizations. Now people that have become very proficient in R will have the ability to use rich visualizations and people who are newer to R and looking to do more predictive modeling will have an entry way into the solution.

We have had heard so many positive conversations around this topic, that we are focusing our entire first meetup of our Business Intelligence Chicagloand group and community around it. Chad Dotzenrod will lead a discussion and demonstration for the group on Tableau and R. I’d encourage you to join us if you’re available and want to learn more on <strong>Thursday, February 20th at Pinstripes in Oak Brook</strong>. The event starts at 5:30 PM, the presentation will be at 6:00 PM, and then you can stay for bowling and bocce and lots of other fun discussions around BI.

You can register for the business intelligence meetup event at the following link: <a title="Business Intelligence Meetup" href="http://www.swc.com/html/email/businessintmeetup/meetup2-20-14.html">http://www.swc.com/html/email/businessintmeetup/meetup2-20-14.html</a>

If you are not able to make the event, we are doing a lot more in the way of technical blogs and providing more information to our business intelligence community groups. So if you haven’t yet subscribed to our blog yet, I encourage you to do so and stay tuned to SWC. We’ll continue to publish great content in the future.

To learn more about Tableau and all of the exciting new features R has for the business intelligence community, please join us for our next informative <a title="Chicago Business Intelligence Event" href="/events">Business Intelligence event</a> or follow <a title="Rachael Narel LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rachael-l-narel-cisa/0/8a5/889/" target="_blank">Rachael Narel on LinkedIn</a>.

		<title>No Biggie: Data As A No Brainer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Data, Information &amp; Knowledge Paradigm</h2>
As information scientists, our goal is to understand the structural and/or functional relationships among data, information and knowledge. Typically, information is defined in terms of data and knowledge in terms of information [1], so it is easy to characterize the three concepts as a continuum. Data is merely raw facts [2], observations and by itself is not usable until it is structured in a usable, relevant form. We call this relevant form information – the meaning we attribute to raw facts. Information is useful because it answers questions such as “who,” “what,” “where,” etc. [2]. Knowledge however is an elusive concept because it originates and is applied in the minds of “knowers,” [3] and then embedded in documents and repositories as well as in organizational routines, processes, practices and norms.
<h2>Business Intelligence and the Big Data Bottleneck</h2>
<a title="Chicago Area Business Intellgence Solutions" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence</a> studies data and information that play a key role in the strategic planning process of a corporation. Companies consume and process information, creating the knowledge to improve decision making, cut costs and identify new business opportunities or inefficient business processes that are ripe for reengineering.

As technology advanced, however, it brought a key problem: collections of data sets so large and complex that it became difficult – if not impossible – to process them using traditional database management tools and data processing applications. You may have heard of it. It’s called Big Data [4]. Some of the challenges of Big Data involve determining whether the quality of information is good and refining the information into usable knowledge.
<h2>Machine Learning: One Step Further</h2>
Big data requires exceptional technologies to efficiently process large quantities of data. One of the suitable technologies is called Machine Learning, a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the construction and study of systems that can learn from data. For example, a system could be trained to understand a user’s past behavior as well as similar decisions made by other users; then use this model to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to a movie or book.

As the number of individuals that are active on a social networking continues to grow, the ability to understand what people say online by the application of data analytics becomes a “no-brainer.” Sentiment Analysis uses social media algorithms to understand the sentiment of customers in real time, knowing how they perceive new products, services or campaigns. It uses Natural Language processing to extract the subjective information with respect to some topic – the attitude of a speaker or writer and whether it is positive, negative or neutral.
<h2>Sentiment Analysis as a Strategic Advantage</h2>
Sentiment Analysis is strategic to any business. Imagine the potential of automating the task of analyzing what is said online providing insights into what customers are really looking for. It enables retailers to develop the product customers want instead of the product marketing departments think they want. Businesses can test hypothesis before spending any capital on product development by observing how customers feel about your brand, how they react to your marketing campaigns and more.

Machine Learning is the holy grail of analytics. It takes Business Intelligence to the next level, bridging the gap between data and real knowledge. It learns from experience automating the task of understanding contextual information, eliminating the need for human intuition and providing insight into the minds of knowers – the customer. There are a wide variety of learning tasks and successful applications. On my next post I will further explore the task of analyzing sentiment and once more try to persuade you that the pressure to exploit analytics as a strategic advantage is increasing for an obvious reason – the high cost of not knowing.

		<title>Why SWC And IT Departments Like Office 365</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/unified-communications/why-swc-it-departments-like-office-365</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft Office 365 is a very popular product that we are hearing a lot of buzz about from our customers. This cloud based solution provides users with access to all of the Microsoft Office applications they use every day, on any device, from any location. The solution gives users Office access and functionality from work, home or even on the road using a large selection of smart and mobile devices. Another reason we like Office 365 is that the product offers stability, reliability and scalability. Microsoft prides itself on achieving 99.9% uptime, data center redundancy and scalability of their Office 365 cloud solution.

Perhaps my favorite benefits of switching to Office 365 are around email. Office 365 significantly reduces the hassles of patching, maintenance and/or upgrading complex on premise mail systems, as the responsibility and costs associated with on premise mail systems are shifted to Microsoft. This includes items such as hardware and maintenance, high availability/Disaster Recovery, backup and recovery, storage space and security and compliance. Office 365 users also have 50GB of email storage and new security tools and features such as <a title="Microsoft Exchange Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Exchange</a> online protection, data loss prevention and even journaling.

IT departments also enjoy the ability to add additional services and/or integration of services in the cloud with Office 365, without the costs of on premise hardware, maintenance, backup and support. This is great for products like <a title="Microsoft Lync Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a>, <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Solutions" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a>, SkyDrive, Office Web App Integration, etc. There is however an increase in cost per user/license depending on which service offerings you choose, but the cost can be tailored accordingly to each user’s requirements or services.

Finally, Office 365’s new Azure Directory Synchronization tool gives users the ability to synchronize local Active Directory account attributes and passwords. One caveat to this is that Active Directory synchronization will make the <a title="Cloud Solutions" href="/solutions/cloud-services">cloud</a> accounts “read only” and all changes must take place in the local Active Directory and this will not provide a “Single Sign On (SSO)” experience. An Active Directory Federation Service is required for this functionality.

If you’d like assistance planning your path to Microsoft Office 365, please contact SWC or join us for our next <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications Event" href="/events">Microsoft Unified Communications event</a>, where we will explore Microsoft Exchange and SWC’s on premise and cloud based email solutions.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s Friday afternoon and the weekend is so close. Then the phone rings. . . and rings again. Soon call volume on the help desk sky rockets and the nightmare begins – a malware outbreak! No one wants to get those calls, yet malware is a stark reality for IT staff and managers. Protecting corporate data and assets is a top priority. Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection provides the reliable protection that all businesses require as part of any “defense in depth” strategy for combating malware. Integration with <a title="Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/configuration-manager-sccm">Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager</a>, cross-platform support, simple configuration and robust reporting are the key to Endpoint Protection’s effectiveness as an industry-leading anti-malware platform.

Deploying and managing Endpoint Protection is accomplished through the Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager console. Having anti-malware management in the same console as application and OS deployment as well as compliance management and inventory provides a true “single pane of glass” view into the entire IT infrastructure. The same staff skillsets leveraged for deploying operating systems and applications can be utilized for rolling out anti-malware software, policies and configuration. Using Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager to deploy and manage Endpoint Protection also reduces the need for learning additional management tools and consoles.

In addition to Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager integration, Endpoint Protection also provides cross-platform anti-malware support. Client software is available both for the Mac platform as well as various Linux platforms. Cross platform support again means a single view into the environment that simplifies management and security of endpoints. Not only is there cross-platform support, but Microsoft recently announced that in spite of the <a title="Windows XP End Of Life" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/april-2014-windows-xp-support-ends">end of life for Windows XP</a>, anti-malware definition updates for the Windows XP platform will continue to be released. This means that while Windows XP systems are being decommissioned, the anti-malware platform can continue to be maintained.

Finally, the Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager console provides robust reporting for Endpoint Protection. An in-console dashboard is available for viewing quick statistics on definition status and malware detections. More detailed out-of-the-box reports are available using the SQL Server Reporting Services back-end provided with Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager. Having insight into the status of the anti-malware platform enables IT to quickly and efficiently remediate any issues.

Friday afternoon calls are never the first choice for any IT manager, but Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection has got you covered – protecting your environment and your weekend!

		<title>SWC Video Featuring Custom Application Development Services</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When Integrity Payment Systems needed to build a custom merchant services application, they turned to SWC’s custom application development team. We created a solution that was scalable and secure, giving Integrity Payment Systems the ability to control every aspect of their customer’s experience as well as provide their employees with all of the information they needed to effectively do their jobs. Watch our video below to learn more about how Integrity Payment Systems has found success using SWC’s <a title="Custom Application Development Services" href="/solutions/custom-application-development">custom application development services</a>.
<a title="Chicago Area IT Consultants Create Custom Merchant Services Application" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wVC9Fne6P6I?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/integrity-payment-systems-custom-application-development-video.jpg" alt="Integrity Payment Systems Custom Application Development Video" width="500" height="281" /></a>
Integrity Payment Systems is a merchant service provider and acquirer of merchant processing. The average person walking down the street probably has no idea how credit cards flow once they walk into a store. They think they swipe their card and Visa takes care of everything, but in between Visa and that card holder there is a whole industry of merchant service providers that ensure those merchants are set up to accept the card, that the card gets charged properly and that the merchant gets paid properly.

<a title="Integrity Payment Systems Case Study Video" href="/perspective/videos/integrity-payment-systems-custom-application">Integrity Payment Systems</a> is a unique business, it’s a closely held business and processes approximately $3.5 billion worth of credit card transactions each year. The company felt they needed to build a custom merchant services application that would give them control over every aspect of the customer experience as well as make sure that their own employees had to all of the information they needed to effectively do their jobs and provide exceptional customer service.

There are several things that are important when you’re implementing a merchant services application. First is the ability to scale the system very quickly. Second is having a robust Disaster Recovery solution that allows you to quickly get your systems back online – in hours and not days. Third is a very robust security posture, so that you can keep your clients data secure as well as pass all of the compliance audits that are necessary.

The thing that set SWC apart for Integrity Payment Systems was the way that they immersed themselves into their business. They basically came onsite and worked really closely with business users in terms of understanding how they did their day-to-day work. Integrity Payment Systems had a very compressed schedule for development for this project, so even after they went live on the new system, SWC resources still worked with them very closely in terms of extending and expanding functionality and also worked with their development team to transition the technology so that they felt comfortable supporting it.

		<title>Have We Forgotten How to Fix Problems?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week my check engine light came on. Rats! To pile onto the problem, the engine enforced some sort of safety governor that limited my speed to 40 MPH. Double rats! I knew this couldn’t be good. Later as I sat at the dealership waiting for the bad news, I learned a sensor in the throttle body had shorted out. Perfect, let’s get a new sensor and be on our way then – of course, the resolution was not so easy! The service tech went on to say that in this situation the sensor could not be fixed and the entire throttle body has to be pitched for a new one. I’ve heard this story before. About a year ago I had a sensor issue with the catalytic convertor and sure enough I had to replace the entire catalytic converter to fix that situation as well. It seems like nothing is truly repaired anymore these days. This is a really hard reality for me to endorse or even understand. I come from a family that ran a highly successful farm implement dealership back in the day. My Grandfather and his brothers serviced many products and encountered every manor of mechanical disaster. The fact that they sold great products was not what made them successful. They also serviced those great products and solved hard problems. I actually watched one of my uncles make the main engine bearings for an old engine instead of searching for the replacement part. But today, some of these mechanical skills are lost due to computer diagnosis and replacing whatever parts the software tells you to replace.

In my field, <a title="Business Intelligence Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence</a>, there can be a tendency to take the same approach. “Your <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL Server</a> is too old and you need to upgrade or change vendors.” “Your SQL EDW is old school and you need to think about Big Data.” “Our team doesn’t use your ETL tool, you need to migrate to a new ETL tool.” And the list goes on. Now I’m certainly not advocating that keeping old technology around is always a good thing. I just feel like sometimes there is a tendency to hit the easy button and just start over with new parts. It doesn’t always have to be that way. Shouldn’t the focus be on gaining ROI and solving business problems? Sometimes too much money is spent on shiny new toys when the old toys just need a little care and maintenance.
<h2>Assessment And Diagnosis Are Important!</h2>
All of our BI projects here at SWC include time to do the assessment/discovery. Sometimes clients push back on that part of the budget, which is totally understandable. But the time we spend doing the assessment helps solidify what it is we are trying to solve. We always have some ideas on what we think we’re going to deliver but it’s good to have the assessment to confirm what we said during the sales process. The primary purpose of the assessment is to determine what is truly broken and if our approach will solve those issues.

We get the opportunity to fix a lot of BI dysfunction. If there wasn’t dysfunction, I’d probably be looking for a career change real quick! Often the dysfunction isn’t the tools and technology; it’s the process. So what good is it to replace one set of tools for another if the business process isn’t addressed. Or in other situations, are the present tools being leveraged to their fullest capability to solve the current problems. Good consultants dig into those topics. We apply the technology skills where necessary and we ensure that the customers problems are being solved both technically and functionally. I’m never going to rebuild the main engine bearings for a skid-steer loader, but I will steer my customers through a difficult BI landscape with many moving parts. And I don’t need a diagnostic report to tell me what to do!

My Grandfather and his brother built this one and several like it. At the time (mid-1960s) four wheel drive farm power was not a reality. But, the market demanded more power and they delivered it in a very creative way. I like to think we use that same can-do spirit here at SWC when we are solving hard technical problems, particularly in the BI space that I work in!</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, I want to talk to you about <a title="System Center Protection Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/data-protection-manager">Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager</a>, a scalable and cost-effective solution used to backup, replicate and restore the critical data in your infrastructure. Watch my latest “Ask SWC” video to learn more.
<a title="System Center 2012 Data Protection Manager" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dnePeTgYm9E?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="System Center 2012 Data Protection Manager" width="474" height="262" /></a>
<a title="Microsoft System Center 2012 R2" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/microsoft-system-center-2012-r2">Microsoft System Center 2012 R2</a> Data Protection Manager or DPM is specifically designed to protect and backup your critical Microsoft workloads, such as <a title="Microsoft Exchange Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Microsoft Exchange</a>, <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server</a>, <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Solutions" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a>, <a title="Microsoft CRM Consulting" href="/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a>, <a title="Microsoft Hyper-V" href="/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v">Microsoft Hyper-V</a> or <a title="Virtualization Solutions" href="/solutions/virtualization">virtualization solution</a> and file servers. In today’s fast paced IT environment, you can have all of the redundancy in the world built into your infrastructure – multiple firewalls, redundant switch core stacks, redundant ISP links and redundant servers, but still lack the ability to protect your data against corruption or loss. Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager gives your team the tools to backup and replicate your data every 15 minutes to disk, tape and/or offsite data warehouse locations such as Windows Azure or the <a title="Recovery Cloud Services" href="/solutions/cloud-services/recovery-cloud">SWC Recovery Cloud</a>. This provides you with the assurance that no matter what the situation, you will be able to protect and safeguard the critical data in your infrastructure. Additionally, Data Protection Manager provides IT departments with the tools necessary to design, implement and maintain a solid Disaster Recovery Plan.

Microsoft System Center 2012 R2’s newest release of Data Protection Manager provides enhancements and new features for Windows Azure Backup, SQL Server cluster support and deploying the solution in a virtual environment. If you’re looking for a strong solution for back up, replication and restoration of all of the data in your infrastructure, contact us to learn more about what Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager has to offer your organization.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been trying to come up with a more compelling way to describe the challenges that organizations face when deploying <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Solutions" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a>. Talking about “implementation planning and design,” “organizational change management,” “user adoption” and “governance” only goes so far. What I want to do instead is “paint a picture” for people, to help them relate to something a little more tangible than those vague, conceptual phrases. I found my inspiration – where else? – on television!

When you roll out or deploy <a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-2013">Microsoft SharePoint 2013</a> without the right strategy and approach, it's kind of like stranding all of your users in a deep, dark, remote jungle. They find themselves alone in the wilderness, facing a big intimidating and potentially scary thing. All that they knew and understood is out of reach and new obstacles and challenges stand in their way. Each and every individual has to explore and conquer the unknown, in order to survive.

Maybe some of those folks are unusually adventurous and are more comfortable wielding the machete and fighting their own way through the jungle. Perhaps some are natural leaders and will help the others learn how to cope or even thrive. But, the cruel reality is that most people will simply be wandering around lost and unsure what to do about it.

What can we do to help everyone make it through the SharePoint jungle and reach their goals successfully? First, we need to hack through all the vines to create a safe and comfortable place to live. Then, we have to provide a map to help people skirt the sinkholes, avoid the predators and get to where they need to go. We need to teach them the differences between the poison berries and the ripe fruit, so they can feed themselves. And finally, we need to define some simple rules, so they can all live together in peace and harmony for the rest of their time in the jungle, until they can be saved (by the coming weekend, of course!)

All of this is without a doubt, easier said than done. But, with the right skills, tools and plans, it IS possible to save your users from the SharePoint Jungle – before they are lost forever!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/data-protection-manager">System Center Data Protection Manager 2012 R2</a> (SCDPM) provides unified data protection for Windows servers and clients, helping your organization deliver scalable, manageable and cost-effective protection and restore scenarios. Here are a few ways you can integrate Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager into your environment as a powerful backup solution.

Via an agent, System Center Data Protection Manager can perform disk-to-disk backups in real time. Different retention policies can be set for clients and servers, such as how often the backup jobs run and how long to retain the data on disk. Clients can even be backed-up over Direct Access and in cases when the client is disconnected from the network, the jobs still run locally, creating Volume Shadow Copies (VSS) which will then sync up to the SCDPM server when connectivity is re-established.

From there, several avenues are available. The data can be exported to tape for offsite long-term retention and SCDPM can share a tape library with other products, such as IBM Tivoli. Or multiple SCDPM servers can be configured to replicate with one another between sites. A third option is backup to Windows Azure storage, which is available right from the console. Any or all of these methods can be used to perform granular VSS backup/restore of <a title="Microsoft Hyper-V" href="/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v">Microsoft Hyper-V</a>, Exchange, SharePoint, Files and Active Directory.

As with the other products in the Microsoft System Center suite, <a title="SCDPM" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/data-protection-manager">SCDPM</a> has cross-platform capabilities. It can snapshot Linux VMs running under Microsoft Hyper-V while they are online, as long as current Integration Services are installed into the kernel. On clusters, SCDPM can integrate with SAN hardware to offload data transfers and minimize the time spent on redirected IO, reducing backup time. Most SAN vendors provide a VSS requestor that talks to a VSS writer installed on the SCDPM server and all cluster nodes. In cases where third party software provides a generic VSS interface, such as with Oracle databases, its data can be presented to SCDPM for application-consistent backups.

Information gathered by Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager can be disseminated throughout System Center, in order to increase its effectiveness and visibility. For example, SCDPM can enforce compliance baselines that detect whether or not a managed computer has the SCDPM agent installed, or whether backup jobs have been configured and trigger remediation as needed. In the event of problems with backups, failed jobs will be relayed to <a title="Microsoft System Center Operations Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/operations-manager-scom">System Center Operations Manager</a>, which can then trigger incident tickets in <a title="System Center Service Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/service-manager">System Center Service Manager</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A lot of people have been asking about Master Data Services as a <a title="Business Intelligence Solutions" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence Solution</a>. Watch my latest episode of “Ask SWC” to learn more about what’s new with Master Data Services in Microsoft SQL Server 2012.
<a title="MDS and SQL Server 2012" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NBkMEJJsTOQ?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC MDS and SQL Server 2012" width="474" height="262" /></a>
Master Data Services or MDS is a great Business Intelligence solution that we offer our customers as part of the <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Services" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server 2012</a> stack. MDS can be used to connect to any domain and manage customers, products or accounts. SWC’s customers really like Master Data Services because it allows any business user to manage data themselves, significantly reducing the need for IT resources to spend their time fixing data or hierarchy definitions.

New MDS features include hierarchies, granular security, transactions and data versioning and business rules. Microsoft Data Quality Services can also be used to compare two data sources and provide suggestions and confidence of change accuracy. Perhaps, my favorite new Master Data Services tool is the Microsoft Excel add-in, which allows users to connect to the MDS database and load a filtered set of data to work with in Excel and then publish it back to the database. In Excel users can sort the data, filter it and make any changes in a familiar format, then apply those changes in the MDS database.

Finally, Microsoft has also made some improvements to their Master Data Services web interface, including an improved user interface. Silverlight has also been integrated to allow users to add, delete or move members in a hierarchy.

To learn more about Master Data Services or how SWC can help you implement this Business Intelligence solution, please join us for our next informative <a title="Chicago Business Intelligence Events" href="/events">Business Intelligence event</a>.
<h2>MDS BI Community Meetup</h2>
SWC is hosting a Master Data Services Business Intelligence Community Meetup on March 20th at our office. Our MDS expert, Jeff Hellesen will lead a discussion and demonstration for the group on uncovering the power of Microsoft Data Quality Services. I’d encourage you to join us if you’re available and want to learn more. The event starts at 5:30 PM and the presentation will begin at 6:00 PM. Pizza and pop will be served and we hope everyone will stay after the presentation is over to network and meet other business intelligence professionals and keep the conversation going.

You can register for the business intelligence meetup event at the following link: <a title="BI Meetup" href="http://www.swc.com/html/email/businessintmeetup/meetup3-20-14.html" target="_blank">http://www.swc.com/html/email/businessintmeetup/meetup3-20-14.html</a>

If you are not able to make the event, I encourage you to subscribe to our blog, as we will continue to publish more technical content and provide additional information about our business intelligence community groups and technical webinars.

		<title>Microsoft Lync Tip For Conflicting Conference Calls</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever booked a back-to-back conference call using <a title="Microsoft Lync Consulting Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> and had a client or coworker join the bridge, just as your wrapping up another call? It happens more than you think and there is a simple and quick way you can avoid this from happening the next time you decide to schedule a meeting using Microsoft Lync.

Microsoft Lync has a cool feature in the meeting options tab that builds private bridges or <strong>“meeting spaces.”</strong> Meeting spaces basically determine where you want to meet online. Here’s what you should do the next time you schedule a back-to-back conference call:
<ol>
	<li>Create a new Lync meeting, or open up an existing one (this can be recurring too!)</li>
	<li>On the top ribbon, click on Meeting Options<img class="wp-image-12062 alignnone" title="Microsoft Lync Ribbon" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-lync-ribbon-031714.png" alt="Microsoft Lync Ribbon" width="600" height="209" /></li>
	<li>Pick “A new meeting space (I control permissions)” and then customize the settings to suit your call’s needs. Typically all of your meetings are held in the same space with the same entry information. But when you choose a new meeting space, there is unique entry information and you will be able to control who gets admitted into the meeting and what they can do when they are there.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12063" title="Microsoft Lync Meeting Space" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-lync-meeting-space-031714.png" alt="Microsoft Lync Meeting Space" width="600" height="209" /></li>
	<li>You can then click on Remember Settings and it will keep the customizations so that every future meeting you create will then have a unique Conference ID.</li>
</ol>
For more information from Microsoft on Lync meetings, you can check out: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/lync-help/set-options-for-lync-meetings-HA102809361.aspx" target="_blank">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/lync-help/set-options-for-lync-meetings-HA102809361.aspx</a>

<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> If you’re the presenter and you’re done with the conference call, make sure you end it with <strong>“End Meeting,”</strong> otherwise other presenters or callers may remain in the bridge. Hanging up a meeting won’t end it unless you are the last presenter to leave the meeting.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12064" title="Microsoft Lync End Meeting" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-lync-end-meeting-031714.png" alt="Microsoft Lync End Meeting" width="600" height="218" />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the recent news of hacks and confidential information being compromised there are three important things you can do to help keep your network and data safe. Check out my “Ask SWC” video to learn more.
<a title="3 Tips to Protect Your Network" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qEkIfARtggc?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC MDS and SQL Server 2012" width="474" height="262" /></a>
In this episode of “Ask SWC,” I wanted to share three tips to help protect you and keep your company’s network safe, so that none of your confidential data will be compromised or stolen. Here are my top three safety tips:
<ul>
	<li>The first tip is to make you password at least 15 characters long</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The second tip is to never click on any malicious link in a spam email</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The third tip is to always remember to lock your computer when you walk away from your desk</li>
</ul>
If you need help with security objectives or would like to further discuss how to keep your company’s network safe, please contact SWC. If you would like to learn more about <a title="Managed IT" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">Managed IT</a> and Security Services, please join us for our next informative <a title="Managed Services event" href="/events">Managed Services event</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="System Center Operations Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/operations-manager-scom">Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2012 R2</a> (SCOM) provides deep application diagnostics and infrastructure monitoring that can help ensure the predictable performance and availability of vital applications. By integrating System Center Operations Manager 2012 R2 (SCOM) into your IT environment, you will have a comprehensive and unified view of your datacenter, private and public clouds.

When you upgrade to System Center Operations Manager 2012 R2 (SCOM), Microsoft’s extended network monitoring is available for newer SNMP devices and basic monitoring for older devices. Network devices provide out-of-the-box discovery, monitoring and reporting on items like:
<ul>
	<li>Memory utilization</li>
	<li>Processor utilization</li>
	<li>Port traffic volume</li>
	<li>Port error analysis</li>
	<li>Port packet analysis</li>
</ul>
System Center Operations Manager 2012 R2 (SCOM) can also show which downstream servers may be impacted by device outages based on dependency trees such as:
<ul>
	<li>Bridges</li>
	<li>Firewalls</li>
	<li>Load balancers</li>
	<li>Switches</li>
</ul>
HSRP groups and VLAN memberships are also tracked and visible in the Network Node Dashboard, which present Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

When Microsoft purchased AVIcode technologies several years ago, it began integrating these .NET application performance monitoring tools into Visual Studio IntelliTrace diagnostics and into System Center Operations Manager (SCOM). In <a title="System Center 2012 R2" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/microsoft-system-center-2012-r2">Microsoft System Center 2012 R2</a> these can be found in the System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) web portal. This same toolset has been extended to support Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) applications via MBeans JMEs, such as Apache Tomcat and Oracle.

Alerting and notifications can then be integrated with Microsoft System Center Service Manager for ticketing incident management and data trending analysis in the data warehouse, which can trigger auto-remediation via runbooks in Microsoft System Center Orchestrator, executing tasks based on events and patterns.

When integrated with Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager, System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) enables Performance Resource Optimization (PRO) tips and can analyze common misconfigurations, such as automatically load balancing VMs between nodes of a cluster. In a similar fashion, integration with Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager allows backups to be tracked and remediated from directly within the System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) console. Or it can just publish the dashboards to Microsoft SharePoint via the System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) web parts.

Cross-platform features include agents for Linux, UNIX and Mac. In addition, there are third party Management Packs (MPs) available from vendors such as Citrix, Dell, HP, Veeam and many others – all of which can extend System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) and centralize complex sets of software and hardware details. And many of these are free, integrating cross-platforms via industry standard protocols, such as the Common Information Model (CIM) or Web Services Management (WSMAN), in addition to native Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

Of course, traditional Windows MPs have all been upgraded to support the latest generations of Microsoft products, such as: DHCP, DNS, WDS, NPS, ADDS, ADSS, ADDT, ADCS and other related server technologies, including Microsoft Exchange, Lync and SharePoint.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When enabling users for the first time in <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a>, we get a lot of requests for bulk enabling based on group membership or other factors. If this is something that you would like to do, you don’t need a fancy tool, you just need to check out the get-csaduser command in Powershell: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398592.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398592.aspx</a>

<strong>Here’s a sample command to get you started:</strong>
<blockquote>get-csaduser -LDAPFilter {(memberOf=CN=Your Group Name,OU=Your OU,DC=domain,DC=com)} | enable-csuser -registrarpool "Yourpool.domain.com" -sipaddresstype emailaddress</blockquote>
<strong>If you wanted to enable all Microsoft Lync users by OU try this:</strong>
<blockquote>Get-CsAdUser -OU "ou=Your OU Name,dc=domain,dc=com" | enable-csuser -registrarpool "Yourpool.domain.com" -sipaddresstype emailaddress</blockquote>
I hope you enjoyed this quick tip on enabling users for the first time in Microsoft Lync.

		<title>It’s The Data Quality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Success in <a title="Business Intelligence Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a> usually boils down to doing the simple things well. One area we never lose sight of at SWC is the focus and passion for “Data Quality” in all of our projects. Quality is not a feature you add in at the end of the project or mention in a design artifact. Quality has to be pervasive through the entire project and exist even after delivery has been wrapped up.
<h2>Embedding Data Quality</h2>
A few years ago the business intelligence team at SWC was taking stock of our approach to BI and looking for an opportunity to inject SWC IP into our projects. We were looking to do something that would separate us from our competitors and leave a long lasting impression on our customer base. We came to the realization that “Data Quality” on our BI projects was a substantial manual effort and seemed to be re-invented each time we did a new project. And so the advent of “Data Sentinel” came to fruition. The “Data Sentinel” or DS tool/framework was our answer to ensuring a repeatable process. The tool would ensure quality on all of our projects, be easy to use/configure and be extensible for those clients that desired to enhance the tool at their discretion. The tool was an immediate success! All of our customer’s using Data Sentinel continue to use, embrace and enhance its adoption to this day. We even have customers using Data Sentinel to monitor business KPIs for organizational health.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12347" title="SWC BI Blog Chad Dotzenrod Data Quality" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-bi-blog-chad-dotzenrod-data-quality-.png" alt="SWC BI Blog Chad Dotzenrod Data Quality" width="500" height="216" />
<h2>Keeping It Simple</h2>
One of core requirements when building Data Sentinel was that it had to be easy to configure/install. We envisioned that business analysts, data analysts, test engineers and developers of all skill levels would use the tool. Each Data Quality configuration has the following components:
<ul>
	<li>Regression tests need to live in a container or group so that they can be better categorized. Tests that are mission critical go in the mission critical test group and tests that are important to a particular division or group can defined in groups along the organizational structure. Any grouping structure needed can be defined.</li>
	<li>Within a group there will be one or more tests. Typically on a BI project, you will have a measure or KPI that is important to the organization and ensuring the quality of that measure means checking data at several junctures in the process. For example, if we had a measure for “Order Amount” we would need to check the aggregate at the semantic layer/cube, data warehouse, staging database and source system.</li>
	<li>Within a given test there will be one or more steps. Building on the example from #2, the test steps would be to get counts from each data retention point and require that the count for all the steps be equal. If the source system says MTD “Order Amount” is $7 million, then each of the data points after the source system also have to be $7 million as well. As you can imagine, if there is a breakdown early in the process, everything downstream is going to be inaccurate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making Quality Pervasive</h2>
We use Data Sentinel on our BI projects along the entire promotion path starting at the local development machine and from there depending on our customer’s SDLC we will have additional checkpoints along the way. A typical BI project assumes: Local Machine, Development Server, Smoke Test Server, QA, Stage and Production. The automated regression testing is always ongoing and because it is automated, we also tie it into the software build process so that we know immediately if a software build has introduced data quality problems. So in closing, by making data quality a major focus to our practice area and building tools that automate this time consuming test we get to spend more of our time solving the harder problems and let our framework ensure the quality of the solution.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Microsoft System Orchestrator" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/orchestrator">Microsoft System Center Orchestrator 2012 R2</a> provides coordinated integration and automation of IT processes through the creation of runbooks that can help to define and standardize best practices and improve operational efficiency. We like System Orchestrator 2012 R2 because it combines functions for all of the other products in the Microsoft System Center Suite via workflows. There are also expansion packs that exist in order to interface with other products like HP iLOs, IBM Netcool Omnibus and VMWare vSphere. Robust PowerShell scripts can also be leveraged to communicate across platforms using standardized CIM and WSMAN protocols to retrieve information from Windows, Linux and UNIX computers.

For example, <a title="System Center Configuration Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/configuration-manager-sccm">System Center Configuration Manager</a> can call runbooks in Task Sequences during Operating System Deployment. Events from System Center Operations Manager can also trigger automated remediation actions, such as triggering a failover to a standby Hyper-V replica and activating it. Or even coordinate a series of reboot cycles throughout the datacenter via Cluster Aware Updating.

All of this is great for the IT admin. But how can Orchestrator benefit the end-user? Microsoft System Center Service Manager provides a SharePoint-based self-service portal, which can be configured to present any number of offerings to corporate staffers, based on their roles and responsibilities. For instance, Human Resources must regularly request that Active Directory accounts be created and deactivated. By filling out a form, HR can submit all of the necessary user details to Service Manager, such as group memberships and submit it to the system. This will subsequently kickoff a runbook to perform the task, rather than asking someone in IT to handle it manually. This can include a multitude of related things like enrolling the user in Exchange and Lync, registering them for the appropriate communications channels and requisitioning a laptop.

Still not enough? Then program runbooks to use your own utilities and scripts – the sky is the limit! Or just contact SWC to find out how we can assist with your operational automation needs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today is the day we have been warning you about for some time. The day <a title="Microsoft XP End Of Life" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows/april-2014-windows-xp-support-ends">Microsoft ends support for Windows XP</a> and even though all of the XP devices in the world will not be self-destructing today, there are some important things you need to know if you continue to use it as your operating system.

After today there will be no more security updates or support for Windows XP. This will leave users vulnerable to malware and other security risks. Even if you have anti-virus software, that may not be enough to protect your business or data from risks such as viruses, spyware and other malicious software. Additionally, if your business is governed by a regulatory requirements like PCI, you may find yourself incompliant.

Some Windows XP users have chosen to ignore the April 8th deadline, as Microsoft recently released that they will be providing an extension of anti-malware for Windows XP until 2015. However, this doesn’t do a lot for XP users and there are still some glaring security holes for those running XP, as operating systems will no longer be patched. The 2015 anti-malware extension really means that Microsoft will provide updates for Microsoft Security Essentials and virus definition updates for Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection users.

SWC has created some additional resources to help you better understand Windows XP end of life and the impact it can have on your business:

Finally, SWC offers desktop deployment assessments to help you identify where your vulnerabilities are and seamlessly migrate your business to the right desktop operating system.

		<title>Ask SWC: What’s New in SQL Server 2014?</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/ask-swc/whats-new-in-sql-server-2014</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft just announced the release of SQL Server 2014 this week. As you know <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL Server 2012</a> came out some time ago and was heavily focused on a lot of Business Intelligence improvements for the enterprise. Now all of a sudden we have many users adopting BI that are hitting our SQL Servers pretty hard. As a result, Microsoft has focused on more performance enhancements in the 2014 release. Watch my “Ask SWC” blog to learn more.
<a title="SQL Server 2014 New BI Features" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OHPirpW4uwE?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="SQL Server 2014 New BI Features" width="474" height="262" /></a>
Microsoft SQL Server 2014 is a comprehensive data platform and <a title="Business Intelligence Solutions" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence solution</a>. Some of the new 2014 features include enhancements to in-memory built in technologies, so things run faster within the organization like Pivots. Microsoft has also included high concurrency to eliminate redundancy in the enterprise and additional performance improvements that have people reporting 25-35% faster performance for the BI assets they have running. Speaking of BI assets, along the way of SQL 2012, we moved forward to the new Power View asset from a Tabular model to a multi-dimensional cube being utilized in the backend, which is now officially integrated within the new SQL Server 2014 release. Additionally, Microsoft has extended the AlwaysOn functionality that was brought to us in SQL Server 2012. This is the ability to have replication to multiple locations, in the past there were only three servers and now you can leverage eight. There are also many backup opportunities as well as backup in the cloud with Windows Azure integration in SQL Server 2014.

Speaking of the cloud, this is going to be your first launch into Power BI integration in Office 365. We talked a little bit about the official launch of Power BI, a self-service business intelligence solution, a few weeks ago and SQL Server 2014 is going to enable that because with Microsoft you can not only use the cloud information, but you can also use the on-premise data as well. Microsoft SQL Server 2014 will definitely provide a powerful asset to your organization.

At SWC, we have a lot of exciting Business Intelligence events coming up in the next couple weeks that will give you the opportunity to come talk to us about new SQL Server 2014 features and functions as well as continuing the cloud discussion.

The first event is our traditional Business Intelligence luncheon on April 24th in Oak Brook, where I will explore a lot of different topics and technologies related to Business Intelligence. Click here to register: <a title="Business Intelligence Event April 24 2014" href="http://www.swc.com/html/email/bi/event/2014-bi4-24-14.html" target="_blank">http://www.swc.com/html/email/bi/event/2014-bi4-24-14.html</a>

On April 15th we are also going to have a BI Meetup in the evening at our Oak Brook office, which will be focused on Power BI. Click here to register: <a title="Business Intelligence Event April 15 2014" href="http://www.swc.com/html/email/businessintmeetup/meetup4-15-14.html" target="_blank">http://www.swc.com/html/email/businessintmeetup/meetup4-15-14.htm</a>l

If you are unable to make our events, we are creating a lot more technical blogs, so I encourage you to subscribe and stay tuned as we will continue to publish more great BI content in the future.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your data warehouse started so perfect! It was a lean mean analytical machine. Then reality set in. The users fed it all the data they could get their hands on. When it got fat and slow, they refused to put it on a diet because they need “everything!” Data archival just isn’t in the cards and never seems to be with any data warehouse these days.

What’s a <a title="Business Intelligence Technologists" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">BI technologist</a> to do? Enter database partitioning. Before we get into the details though, a few questions need to be answered:
<ol>
	<li>Does my data warehouse have tables that contain hundreds of millions of records?</li>
	<li>Are the queries accessing identifiable subsets of the data?</li>
	<li>Are the subsets of rough equal size and are there enough of them?</li>
	<li>If your data changes, will it stay in the same subset?</li>
</ol>
If you said yes to all of these questions, you might be a candidate for partitioning.

There are many ways to partition data and the strategy is often case specific. For our example we’ll assume that the best way to partition the data is to group the data by sales region. Imagine a company with five sales regions and billions of orders spread relatively evenly across all sales regions.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12544" title="My Business Intelligence Map Of USA" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/my-bi-fat-map.png" alt="My Business Intelligence Map Of USA" width="500" height="282" />

Why would I partition this way? Primarily, sales data is generally analyzed by region and then by time and other attributes. Additionally, the sales regions are static and rarely change. When the company grows larger, new sales regions can be added or we can re-partition by region and additional attributes.

<strong>What’s the overhead of partitioning?</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Licensing. Partitioning is often considered an advanced or enterprise type feature. This means that standard edition <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL Server</a> will not support this feature and you will have to upgrade.</li>
	<li>These partitions don’t maintain themselves. Initial setup and ongoing care and feeding will be required.</li>
	<li>Partitioned tables will consume more disk space. This is a tradeoff for increased performance.</li>
	<li>Experienced resources that can design and implement the solution from a business and technical perspective will also be needed.</li>
</ul>
<strong>What to do?</strong>
<ul>
	<li>First and foremost, profile the data and how it is used in the business</li>
	<li>What parts of the information flow are experiencing the most pain? Some of you will experience painful data integration whereas others will see issues at the client interface layer. The symptoms vary by case.</li>
	<li>Design the partitioning strategy</li>
	<li>Assess how future growth and change will affect your partition strategy</li>
	<li>On a smaller scale, validate your strategy before committing too much time or resources.</li>
</ul>
You may want to consider bringing in experience consultants for guidance, design validation or actual implementation to ensure your project is a success.

		<title>Heartbleed Is Much Worse Than We Thought</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/technology/heartbleed-is-much-worse-than-we-thought</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every so often in information security a vulnerability is publicly disclosed that scares even the most seasoned security professionals, Heartbleed is one of those vulnerabilities. The Heartbleed bug concerns an implementation flaw of the Heartbeat function in OpenSSL. In short, Heartbleed takes advantage of a missed boundary check in a heartbeat reply from a system. The net effect enables an attacker to send a hearbeat request and get back more data than was sent. In this instance that additional data comes straight from the target’s memory and could include usernames, passwords, private keys, sessionIDs, credit card data, the list goes on and on.

What is particularly troublesome about this vulnerability is the wide array of systems it affects. At first glance the thought was that this only affects Linux servers which by default run OpenSSL. Quickly the community realized this traverses everything from tablets to routers all the way down to applications downloaded from the Android Play Store. The reality has become much clearer in the weeks following the initial release and security experts are warning that any device connected to a network and running OpenSSL is vulnerable to attack. It’s important to understand that this is not just a server vulnerability, clients are just as vulnerable if a server responds to its request with a malicious heartbeat of its own. Even worse we are now seeing large farms of systems in China actively scanning the entire internet IP space indiscriminately for vulnerable systems to exploit.

<h2>Chicago Area IT Security Services 630-572-0240</h2>

So what can we do to protect ourselves and how do we even know if we have a vulnerable device in the Internet of things that reside on our network? Fortunately, security vendors have worked quickly to offer mitigation products to block these attacks; IPS vendors specifically have released signatures for a variety of perimeter protection systems that can detect and block attacks. However these IPS systems will only go so far as malware is quickly being written to leverage this attack once it is phished into a network or via drive-by download. The only true fool proof mitigation is to patch your systems to the latest version of OpenSSL, currently 1.0.1g, or apply patches from your particular device vendor. Detecting vulnerable devices in your environment can be done with freely available tools posted online, but be careful which tools you use as it’s being reported that only 5% of the tools online are accurately detecting the flaw. One thing is certain – we are only in the beginning phases of this vulnerability lifecycle; experts are estimating that it will take years to patch all vulnerable devices and replace any compromised SSL certificates.

SWC is currently performing Heartbleed detection and remediation for customers. If you have questions about Heartbleed or other threats to your security, please contact SWC. We will also be hosting an online conference on <strong>Monday, April 21st at 11 AM</strong> to discuss Heartbleed and answer any questions you may have.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of “Ask SWC” Security Team members Tommy Montgomery and Viral Dhimar discuss the Heartbleed bug. Watch our video to learn more about this malicious exploit.
<a title="Heartbleed - What You Need To Know" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/glkLWDpQMT4?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Technology Partners" width="474" height="262" /></a>
The Heartbleed bug continues to scour the internet malicious exploiting the vulnerable and affecting many popular websites and services. We asked our security expert, Tommy Montgomery, CISSP, ISSMP, CISM, GCFW, C|EH to tell us a little more about Heartbleed and how you can protect your organization.
<h2>What exactly is Heartbleed?</h2>
The Heartbleed is a vulnerability within certain versions of OpenSSL and it really affects the messages that are sent back and forth between clients and servers that keep SSL connections alive. The problem is a missed boundary check within these messages and what that does is it allows an attacker to send a message requesting more information from the server than they should actually be able to receive. Some of the information they get back from the server contains sensitive information like user names, passwords or session IDs – it’s really bad stuff!
<h2>Is Heartbleed as serious as people are saying it is?</h2>
It is. It’s one of the most serious vulnerabilities that we have seen in quite some time. That’s because it affects so much of the internet infrastructure and SSL by nature is usually used to protect sensitive information.

<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Lets-Talk-Heartbleed.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/heartbleed-slides-download.png" alt="Download Heartbleed Slides" title="Download Heartbleed Slides" width="675" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12682" /></a>

<h2>Some sources online say Heartbleed is only affecting servers such as Linux servers, is that true?</h2>
It’s not just servers that are being affected by Heartbleed, it’s actually clients and servers. That can actually be played in reverse, where the server sends a malicious message back to the client and receives information about its memory. It’s also not just Linux servers, it’s really anything, and it’s the internet of things. Heartbleed can affect routers, webcams, medical devices and anything that runs OpenSSL in a vulnerable version.
<h2>How can I protect myself from Heartbleed?</h2>
You can actually use some free online tools and websites that allow you check your servers or devices (check out <a title="Heartbleed Blog" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/technology/heartbleed-is-much-worse-than-we-thought">Tommy’s last blog</a> for the tools). The only problem with that is that some of the tools that are out there require a lot of advance knowledge to run, especially if you are testing devices that are inside your network and not out on the perimeter.

<h2>Chicago Area IT Security Services 630-572-0240</h2>

<h2>How do I find out if I’ve been infected by Heartbleed?</h2>
It’s not so much an infection, but you can find out if you are vulnerable. Other things you can do to mitigate this use perimeter protection devices such as IPS’ with released signatures that you can use to actually block these attacks.
<h2>How Can SWC Help?</h2>
SWC is currently performing Heartbleed detection and remediation for customers. We can scan your entire network and identify vulnerable devices. SWC can also assist in setting up IPS rules to block Heartbleed attacks and can design and implement WAF, IPS, gateway scanner and other mitigating solutions. Finally, SWC can review your current network defenses and identify areas for improvement.

If you have questions about Heartbleed or other threats to your security, please contact SWC today.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, SWC Engineer Gonzalo Escarrá was featured on Telemundo’s national evening news broadcast discussing Google Glass. The product, which was at one time sold only to a limited audience was available to the masses on April 15th, but only for the day.

Check out the segment below.

<a href="http://www.telemundo.com/noticias/2013/04/15/solo-por-un-dia-ponen-la-venta-lentes-de-google-al-publico-video" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11170" title="Gonzalo Escarra SWC Technology Partners Telemundo Taping" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-technology-partners-engineer-google-glass.png" alt="Gonzalo Escarra SWC Technology Partners Telemundo Taping" width="400" height="281" /></a>
<h2>Telemundo English Translation –</h2>
<h3>Google Glass Sold in the U.S</h3>
<strong><em>Google Glass was sold in a limited way and by the end of the year will be available for all.</em></strong>

<strong>Jose Diaz-Balart, Anchor</strong>: For the first time and only for the day, Google Glass was on sale to the public. These technological glasses, which according to many may change the future of mankind. They are like glasses but with a video camera and that sort of thing. Well, Janet Rodriguez has all the details.

<strong>[Revolutionary Technology]</strong>

<strong>Janet Rodríguez, Reporter</strong>: The eyeglass looking to reinvent the world of wearable <a title="SWC Technology Partners" href="http://www.swc.com">technology</a> is for sale for $1,500. To Adrian Fernandez, it’s the ideal device to document your trip.

<strong>Adrian Fernandez, Interviewee</strong>: [I would use Google Glass to] take lots of videos while I'm sightseeing, among other things and take pictures. It seems very comfortable for that.

<strong>Janet Rodríguez, Reporter</strong>: The eyeglass will sell only for a day, through the internet and in limited quantities. Now with more than 10,000 users since its promotion hit the market in 2012.

<strong>[Gonzalo Escarrá –SWC Technology Partners Engineer]</strong>

<strong>Gonzalo Escarrá, SWC Engineer:</strong> It’s like a phone that is integrated into your eye. It's a little screen that has been placed to a lens. Once you get the Google Glass, you can send a text message or are able to see directions.

<strong>Janet Rodríguez, Reporter</strong>: Records video, takes pictures and connects to social networks with a voice command. Technology revolutionized without precedent. This surgeon in Chicago used it to check the patient's x-rays without deviating from the operating table. While this young lady is part of a program to help people with disabilities to create memories, through Google Glass, before thought of as impossible.

<strong>[Janet Rodríguez Chicago, Illinois]</strong>
For now, like every new toy, the curiosity of the unknown and a little fun is what attracts the use of these glasses.

<strong>Janet Rodríguez, Reporter</strong>: In this Chicago hotel, it offers guests to explore the city. Today they have ordered a second pair, technology that brings a lot of controversy. Many fear Google Glass may be an invasion of privacy.
And this woman in San Diego was given a citation for driving while wearing the glasses.

<strong>Gonzalo Escarrá, SWC Engineer</strong>: It's a first generation product. It has some flaws, some problems. But the idea is to get the product to market and see how it works, attract interest.

<strong>Woman, Interviewee</strong>: $1,500 seems excessive. It is also true that everything starts off expensive and then over time prices lower and normalize a bit.

<strong>Janet Rodríguez, Reporter</strong>: So many will wait for the future to see if it sticks and becomes the new technology fury.

In Chicago, Janet Rodriguez Telemundo.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The newest release of <a title="System Center Virtual Machine Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/virtual-machine-manager-app-controller">Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012 R2</a> (SCVMM) includes a product that has considerably evolved. It’s no longer just an advanced Hyper-V console. SCVMM is now a hub for all of the key elements of a cloud computing infrastructure. Read my blog to learn more about why we love SCVMM 2012 R2 and you should too!

SCVMM 2012 R2 is a powerful virtual machine management and service deployment tool that provides support for multi-hypervisor environments, which can help IT deliver a flexible and cost-effective private cloud environment for tenant groups. There are even modules for chargeback reporting, enabling SCVMM 2012 R2 to serve as a central library for organizing machine templates, application profiles and storage tiers. SCVMM 2012 R2 can manage three major hypervisors – <a title="Microsoft Hyper-V" href="/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v">Microsoft Hyper-V</a>, <a title="Vmware Solutions" href="/solutions/virtualization/vmware">VMWare</a> ESX and <a title="Citrix XENapp" href="/solutions/virtualization/citrix-xenapp">Citrix XenServer</a> – which are useful for migration scenarios or large heterogeneous datacenters. Templates can be deployed for Linux VMs, including: RHEL, SUSE, CentOS and Ubuntu. The product also has the ability to let departmental groups, tenants or application managers handle their own VMs – albeit within a policy-based set of constraints and controls, by extending SCVMM 2012 R2 with the Microsoft System Center App Controller web portal.

Cross-platform (XPLAT) standards are implemented across all Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 products via methodologies such as Datacenter Abstraction Layer (DAL) and Open Management Infrastructure (OMI). In SCVMM 2012 R2, full integration is provided for SAN devices supporting the Storage Management Initiative Specification (SMI-S). When using SMS-I compliant storage, SCVMM 2012 R2 can be used to rapidly provision VMs, for example, to a SMB 3.0 file cluster which can perform Offloaded Data Transfer (ODX).

You might be wondering, how SCVMM 2012 R2 integrates with all of the other products in the Microsoft System Center 2012 suite. SCVMM 2012 R2 can share Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) with <a title="System Center Configuration Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/configuration-manager-sccm">Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager</a> to centralize patch management and maintenance schedules. SCVMM 2012 R2 also integrates with System Center Operations Manager to generate PRO tips for host load balancing and dynamic memory management across the virtualization stack. And SCVMM 2012 R2 can even utilize Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to provide greater insight into VM utilization details.

Network layer abstraction is a newer concept which is going to change how we design public and private clouds connectivity. SWC can help you stay on top of this trend, by integrating SCVMM 2012 R2, which provides all of the tools needed to architect it. By using plug-ins for virtual networking devices, such as the Cisco Nexus 1000V, you can facilitate greater degrees of management for virtual infrastructure than ever before. SCVMM 2012 R2 combined with the networking expertise of SWC’s Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) provides a winning combination for the creation and management of a cloud computing infrastructure.

		<title>Deploying On-Premise Dynamics CRM to Remote Users</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If your <a title="Microsoft CRM Services" href="/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a> system doesn’t work on your remote users’ preferred devices, you’re severely limiting their ability to access the system. Couple this with one of the top reasons why people don’t use CRM – because it takes too long, and you may have uncovered two of the most common excuses why your workforce is resisting it. By eliminating these excuses, your organization will start to see a better ROI on your CRM investment.

Internet Facing Deployment (IFD) is a method of deploying an on-premise <a title="Customer Relationship Management System" href="/solutions/crm">CRM system</a> so that remote users can connect to the application from the Internet without being on the company network. This means no more hassling with a VPN. If remote users want to work from the road, without being tethered to the network, setting up the IFD for the Dynamics CRM 2013 on-premise application will enable them to do so with ease.

IFD lets remote users access Dynamics CRM through Microsoft’s free mobile application available for the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=328765" target="_blank">Windows Phone 8</a>, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=313642" target="_blank">Surface tablet</a>, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=328968" target="_blank">iPhone</a>, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=313645" target="_blank">iPad</a> and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=328969" target="_blank">Android</a> devices. These applications make mobile workers more productive by giving them the ability to enter data and important information into CRM on their mobile device while on the road or at a client’s site. In addition to time savings and removing duplication of effort for mobile workers, the added benefit to the organization is that important information is instantly captured in the CRM system for other sales and support team members to access.

Another large benefit of IFD is the ability to use the CRM Outlook client seamlessly. A large hurdle in most deployments of CRM is the CRM Outlook client setup. A typical deployment of Microsoft Dynamics CRM allows the use of the Outlook client only if specific requirements are met. The Outlook client typically requires you to be on the same network as the CRM server in order to connect. With IFD in place, you are able to connect from anywhere. Remote users will enjoy all of the benefits of an on-premise CRM system with access options similar to if the system was hosted in the cloud.

When our clients ask if it’s worth the time to configure IFD for CRM, we say absolutely! Installing IFD does not require a lot of effort and can be done after Microsoft Dynamics CRM has been configured and is in use. If you have Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 and you are not taking advantage of these features feel free to reach out to SWC. We would be happy to help your company achieve this boost in productivity.

		<title>Ask SWC: When It Comes To Custom Application Development What Sets SWC Apart From The Competition?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SWC provides a full-range of <a title="Custom Application Development Services" href="/solutions/custom-application-development">custom application development</a> capabilities. As a multi-practice group, our team leverages the expertise of our software developers, infrastructure engineers and business process consultants to deliver custom business solutions that integrate into new or existing systems. Watch our latest episode of “Ask SWC” to learn more about what sets SWC apart from the competition when it comes to custom application development.
<a title="What Sets SWC Apart From Competition" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/y2d2I9aOCO4?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="SQL Server 2014 New BI Features" width="474" height="262" /></a>

When it comes to SWC’s <a title="Custom Application Development Capabilities" href="/solutions/custom-application-development/capabilities">custom application development services</a>, our competition usually falls into three categories.
<h2>Offshore Teams</h2>
The first is the offshore teams, if you’re well organized and able to deliver detailed requirements for your custom application to them, they are able to build exactly what you’ve asked for, but not necessarily what you need. It’s also very difficult to bring these projects back onshore in a way that allows the business users to digest the system and integrate it into their business process.

<h3>Custom Application Development 630-572-0240</h3>

<h2>Independent Consultants</h2>
The second is independent consultants, they often have a great deal of industry knowledge or a particular technical expertise, but they typically don’t have the broad range of technical expertise that is required to deliver against complex business applications required for today’s mid-market business. They also don’t have a team to back them up. You are reliant on a single person and when they aren’t available or when they move on to the next assignment or project, they are not going to be there to help support your business.
<h2>Enterprise Organizations</h2>
The third is the organizations that typically serve the enterprise and aren’t used to working for the mid-market. Those folks, although they are very capable and have the technical breadth to deliver complex custom applications, often have difficulty scaling their process and methodologies to what is appropriate and pragmatic for the mid-market. And those larger enterprise organizations will frustrate our customers with the amount of time, money and the process that they apply to the solution.

		<title>Ask SWC: What Is SWC’s SharePoint Functional Discovery?</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/what-is-swcs-sharepoint-functional-discovery</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At SWC, we talk to a lot of people that need <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Capabilities" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint capabilities</a> or want to implement an intranet or collaboration site, but aren’t exactly sure what that means. That’s why we offer a SharePoint Functional Discovery session. Watch my “Ask SWC” video to learn more.

<a title="SharePoint Functional Discovery" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EH9Xh4dIKEw?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="SQL Server 2014 New BI Features" width="474" height="262" /></a>

SharePoint is one of Microsoft’s most success products and is considered by Gartner to be one of today’s marketing leading search, portal and content management solutions. The platform is so popular, that worldwide more than 135 million SharePoint licenses have been sold and nearly 80% of Fortune 500 companies are using it. Even though these are huge numbers, more than half of organizations are stalled, struggling or failing with their <a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-2013">Microsoft SharePoint</a> deployments and over a third of users don’t feel like they are using the platform’s full capabilities.

SWC has put together a proven methodology that assists our customers in deploying the right SharePoint solution to meet their business needs by making sure we have the right conversations during our functional discovery session. Since the platform can do so much, the SharePoint functional discovery uncovers what the solution needs to be and how a client is going to get immediate value out of the solution. Instead of just asking people what they want, the SharePoint functional discovery session truly focuses on a customer’s pain points and helps them figure out exactly how they are going to get the best ROI.

<h3>Chicago Area SharePoint Services 630-572-0240</h3>

During our envisioning process, we go through best practices and examples for our <a title="SWC SharePoint Design Portfolio" href="/design-portfolio/sharepoint">SharePoint Portfolio</a> so that the customer can see what their SharePoint environment could be and explore the solution’s numerous features and capabilities in an interactive way. They then learn how the solution works and what others have done in the past to make it a productive tool. Based on SWC’s vast experience, we also know what questions to ask to ensure the SharePoint solution we are deploying solves the organizational problems the client is currently facing.

The SWC functional discovery process is all about helping our clients understand what’s possible and what Microsoft SharePoint can do for their business. This session always ends up being a big win for both the organization’s executives and the people actually using the system.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the economy improves, there are certain industries that are gaining traction, one of them is manufacturing and distribution. Watch my video to learn more about the IT trends and best practices we are seeing in our manufacturing and distribution client base.

<a title="Managed Services Best Practices: IT Industry Trends in Manufacturing & Distribution" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wIe9OBRR9PQ?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/susie-cummings-managed-it-services-video-player.png" alt="Managed IT Services Video" width="400" height="281" /></a>

For a long time the manufacturing and distribution industry was kind of stagnant and now we’re seeing a resurgence in the growth of those organizations. In particular, a lot of organizations with manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Asia. These organizations need to partner with a firm that can help them understand how to monitor, manage and really maintain their IT environments as well as provide strategic guidance on how technology should work. They also need a firm that can deliver the uptime and availability of their IT systems for their users around the clock.

One manufacturing company that SWC worked with had 450 users and two dedicated internal IT folks, one was an IT manager and one a systems administrator. Trying to serve all of their users and maintain and manage the company’s IT environment was a daunting task for two employees. Eventually the business units started to express concerns about response times and the fact that they kept on having issues with the availability and performance of their IT systems.

When SWC got engaged with this organization, one of the areas where we felt we could make an immediate impact was to implement our <a title="Managed IT Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">IT Managed Services</a>, specifically our monitoring services because they were constantly getting surprised. For instance, the team would come into the office and find out that their switch had been down since the night before. A more proactive approach gave this company some peace of mind and understanding into what was going on with their IT systems.

Another area that we focused on through <a title="Chicago Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services">Managed Services</a> was this organization’s service desk. It was impossible for two individuals to handle all of the support requests from the company’s users located across the country. SWC came in and defined our service desk offering, which is essentially creating policies and procedures where their users would contact SWC’s remote service desk and then we would handle all level one requests for those users. We would open tickets and if something needed to be escalated to their internal team, it came from us in a very defined way. We also established escalation procedures around those items to ensure that the user was dealt with as quickly as possible. The fact that we were also monitoring and managing their IT environment, gave us that comprehensive visibility into that organization, such that if a user or group of users had a problem, we could look at the monitoring and say we are seeing some network latency, for instance and be able to troubleshoot that and deal with things in a more holistic way.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At SWC we love playing around with new technologies. One emerging technology that we find particularly exciting is the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, or VDI. VDI is awesome, because it provides new ways to connect workers to the solutions and applications that empower them. Essentially, what VDI does is move the users’ desktop experience from the traditional workstation computer into the datacenter, unbinding them from a physical location and freeing them to work from anywhere. Doing so provides a more agile workflow enabling workers to perform their roles regardless of where they are in the world.

Two of the more popular Virtual Desktop suites that you may have heard of are Citrix XenDesktop and <a title="Vmware Solutions" href="/solutions/virtualization/vmware">VMware</a> Horizon View. In addition, Microsoft Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is proving to be a strong competitor in the VDI workspace. At SWC, we don’t like to play favorites – each of these solutions has its strengths and we can help identify which product is the right <a title="Virtualization Solutions" href="/solutions/virtualization">virtualization solution</a> for your business.In general, a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure solution provides the following benefits to your organization:
<ul>
	<li>The ability to connect your employees with their applications regardless of their device or location</li>
	<li>A consistent application experience from user to user and device to device</li>
	<li>Simplified and centralized management and control of the entire end-user experience</li>
	<li>Increased security and more rapid Disaster Recovery</li>
	<li>Improved employee productivity and agility</li>
	<li>Reduced desktop computer costs</li>
</ul>
Similar to how virtualization radically reinvented how we deploy and manage servers, VDI will drastically change the way we think about the end-user experience. With a properly designed and implemented Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, your business will be more agile than ever – and able to quickly react to the rapidly-changing technological requirements that we all face.

<a title="Contact SWC" href="/contact">Contact SWC</a> if you would like to learn more about leveraging VDI in your environment and be sure to register to our blog, as we will continue to push about more content on the following virtualization topics:
<ul>
	<li>Planning out your Virtual Desktop Infrastructure</li>
	<li>Common VDI Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them</li>
	<li>Leveraging Graphics Acceleration in Your Virtual Environment</li>
	<li>Letting End-Users Help Themselves with Self-Service Application Delivery</li>
	<li>Application Streaming with Microsoft App-V</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For years, <a title="IT consulting firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a> SWC has produced market research surveys that have helped us and our customers navigate the rapid changes and trends of our industry. In the past these efforts have been largely focused on IT decision makers, understanding where they saw upcoming opportunities and challenges. In 2014 we decided to focus our surveys exclusively on the CEO space. Our goal was to capture the IT concerns and desires of the business decision makers and what we learned was pretty interesting. Watch our video below to learn more.
<a title="SWC Technology Partners Tech Trends Survey Snapshot" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Pr-A1sM4Axk?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-tech-trends-survey-video.jpg" alt="SWC Technology Trends Survey" width="474" height="262" /></a>
<h2>Video Commentary and Survey Results</h2>
Since our first <a title="Technology Surveys" href="/perspectives/surveys">technology trends survey</a> we have asked the question “Does your organization perceive IT as strategic.” In 2009, 39% of our IT audience said yes. The same number in 2011. In 2012 we saw an uptick to 46%. This year when we asked our CEOs and Presidents if they perceived IT as strategic and 100% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement. Is it that IT has become that much more strategic over time or do we have a perceived disconnect between the CEO and the CIO?

Another question could be – does the CEO’s perception of IT being strategic translate to the CIO being a strategist for the company? When asked if the CIO or most senior IT executive was a part of the company’s leadership team exactly half said yes. Obviously the makeup of leadership teams will fluctuate radically between companies but there does seem to be a shortfall between the perceived importance of IT and the voice IT has in the direction of the companies they serve.

Further to this point, it appears from the survey results that we will see an increase IT spend this year. 60% of our respondents indicated that they will increase or significantly increase their IT spend in 2014. At SWC we are seeing this upward trend particularly within the <a title="Manufacturing IT Consulting" href="/industry/manufacturing-distribution">manufacturing space</a> – an industry that suffered for years during the recent recession and had to make drastic IT budget cuts (watch our <a title="IT Best Practices" href="/blog/managed-services/best-practices-it-industry-trends-in-manufacturing-distribution">IT Best Practices</a> video to learn more). Today, there is a lot investment to catchup. The challenge with this scenario is that these organizations are asking bare bone IT departments to handle a disproportionate amount of projects, with new technologies – many of which they do not have subject matter expertise on. To a degree this dynamic is reflected in our survey results. More than half of our respondents indicated strategic planning and project execution as their biggest IT challenge.

For some the answer to these challenges will lie in outsourcing or managed services. Of our survey respondents only 28% indicated no plans to consider outsourcing in the future while 88% viewed themselves as strong or opportunistic believers in outsourcing.

On a final “fun” note we asked our respondents where their baseball allegiances lie. The North Side won with 64% admitting to their Cubs fan status – the remaining 36% proclaiming their loyalty to the Sox. Either way, after this long, cold winter it will be great to watch a baseball game outside regardless of which side of the city were on.

This poll has provided some interesting information on executive’s perception of the value of IT within their organizations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I want to talk a little bit about <a title="Microsoft System Center Orchestrator" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/orchestrator">Microsoft System Center Orchestrator</a>. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the product, it’s a powerful datacenter workflow management solution. Watch my “Ask SWC” video to learn more about Microsoft System Center Orchestrator.

<a title="System Center Orchestrator" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fN5QShfBFac?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="SQL Server 2014 New BI Features" width="474" height="262" /></a>

<a title="Microsoft System Center" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center</a> Orchestrator is a datacenter workflow management solution that allows us to automate many of the repeatable and mundane tasks our IT infrastructure is currently carrying out each day, including the creation, monitoring and deployment of resources for both your organization’s public and private cloud environments. In this video blog, I wanted to share with you a quick example of Orchestrator’s abilities which will really open up your eyes to the opportunities and creativity you will have by deploying the solution in your environment. Think about all of the tasks that need to be completed when you onboard a new employee or new user. You have to create usernames and mailboxes, manage permissions, procure hardware, and so on. Unfortunately, these processes don’t stop at the desktop or laptop, new users also have mobile devices – perhaps two or three of them that need to be configured, so there is a lot of provisioning just in software and hardware for these users and it takes a lot of time just to walk through all of the different steps.

Microsoft System Center Orchestrator allows us to create a run book or workflow that will string a whole bunch of different tasks together, or all of the new user IT creation tasks and give us a desired result. The desired result meaning, the new user is all setup in the system and ready to go on their first day of work. All of this can be handled automatically by building workflows through Microsoft System Center Orchestrator. Orchestrator can also help automate other processes in our IT environment, such as integrating systems from outside vendors. Organizations that deploy the product will drastically improve operations by tying together different procedures and tasks in the graphical user-interface. By automating these procedures, not only will you improve the reliability and predictability of your IT environment, but you will also give your internal <a title="Managed IT Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">IT resources</a> more time to focus on more strategic and important initiatives or projects within your organization.

To learn more about how Microsoft System Center and Orchestrator can help to automate your datacenter and better your organization’s IT operations, join us for our next <a title="Microsoft System Center Event" href="/events">Microsoft System Center event</a> or connect with <a title="Brad Ellison LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/brad-ellison/70/1aa/a03" target="_blank">Brad Ellison on LinkedIn</a>.

<h2>Lync Video Troubleshooting</h2>
Have you ever had your Microsoft Lync 2013 video stuck "loading" during a web conference when you try to change your video settings to share video? It's an interesting issue adn your video driver is usually the most common culprit. Here are some suggestions on troubleshooting your Lync 2013 video issues.

Recently, someone in the Lync community reached out to me, because they ran into an issue with the product. Their video never displayed during a video conference and was stuck “loading” the entire time. There is actually a quick fix for this issue. Read my blog to learn more.

Have you ever had your <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013 Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013" target="_blank">Microsoft Lync 2013</a> video stuck “loading” during a web conference when you try to change your video settings or share video? It’s an interesting issue and your video driver is usually the most common culprit. Here are some suggestions on troubleshooting your Lync 2013 video issues.

First, start by updating your video driver. By using a generic driver, the problem may solve itself. If this doesn’t work, then you need to reduce your variables. This can be done by checking your sound, video and Bluetooth drivers.

If you are still experiencing loading issues after updating your video driver and checking your variables, then you may need to disable hardware acceleration, like I did for the user who reached out to me. This particular user had a Dell AIO (all-in-one) desktop and was running Microsoft Lync 2013 on dual monitors. When we checked the video device settings (Lync 2013 -&gt; Tools -&gt; Video Device Settings) the webcam video appeared to be working just fine, the light was even on. But when the user tried to share video, it never displayed and would get stuck “loading” with a blank gray box appearing where the video should have been. There were a couple of things we tried to do to troubleshoot this issue. First we tried to swap the video drivers. Then we tried to update the webcam driver. Finally we tried to disable any other webcam management applications on the system and none of this seemed to work. Then I realized that there were two monitors and two video cards – an AMD Radeon card and Intel HD card. So I decided to disable a video card in the device manager and noticed that the video worked, however at the expense of disabling the second monitor. When I tried the second video card, I experienced the same scenario. So what was the final solution? Using Microsoft Office to disable hardware acceleration was the quick fix and probably the easiest solution.

In Microsoft Office, select File -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced and then choose the Disable Hardware Acceleration box. I have included a screen shot and registry key directory link below for those of you who may want to push this out as quick fix via group policy. You can also use Outlook to disable this with the registry key.

<h2>Registry Key:</h2>
<blockquote>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\Graphics
DWORD: DisableHardwareAcceleration = 1</blockquote>

		<title>SWC Best Practices: Does Outsourcing My Service Desk Make Sense?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve noticed that a lot of executives show up to our managed services events because they have had something happen. Whether they have found out their IT person is looking for a new job, they just got out of a meeting and realized there is a big business initiative that they don’t have enough IT resources to support, or they just aren’t satisfied with their existing <a title="IT Provider" href="http://www.swc.com">IT provider</a>. Watch my video to learn more about managed IT services and why outsourcing IT service desk operations is a best practice for many organizations.

<a title="Managed IT Services Best Practices: Outsourcing Service Desk" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IOU_J0xXQZU?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/susie-cummings-managed-it-services-video-player.png" alt="Managed IT Services Video" width="400" height="281" /></a>

We have had a number of conversations and recently started a relationship with an organization that had outsourced their <a title="IT Services Help Desk" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-help-desk-service-desk-services">IT service desk operations</a> to another company. The organization had an internal IT person focused on their servers and network and chose to outsource IT service desk operations to a third party provider for staff augmentation. The third party provider supplied the organization with a permanent onsite IT service desk resource, and what the organization found was that they began experiencing quite a bit of turnover. Therefore the organization was faced with the challenge of continually having to train their third party IT provider’s onsite resources.

SWC had been marketing to this organization for quite some time and when they faced their final turnover experience with this <a title="Managed IT Solutions" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">IT managed services provider</a>, they gave us a call. We sat down with their organization and strategized on how SWC might be able to deliver a higher level of service to their users through a shared IT services team model, as opposed to being dependent on one or two people, whether they were an outsourced or internal resource. Over the course of time, we developed a custom IT service desk offering for this organization. Now, their users contact SWC for all remote user desktop support. If we run into an issue and we need to escalate support, we escalate it to an internal resource or we have our staff go onsite for support as well. What this has essentially done is lower this organization’s IT service desk costs, while delivering a much higher level of service for their users. Over time, SWC has had the opportunity to get to know this organization more and has become not only a technical resource, but a trusted partner. As a result we have started working on other IT infrastructure projects as well as software solutions projects to better the organization’s operations.

There are many benefits to partnering with an IT managed services provider like SWC for service desk or help desk services. Some of which include:
<ul>
	<li>Centralized tracking of all IT service desk incidents, which provides further information and data on commonly reported user issues. Typically these are the result of larger issues or problems in the IT environment, which we are able to quickly identify and solve.</li>
	<li>Being able to holistically analyze users’ needs and provide recommendations on ways to improve efficiency and productivity within the organization</li>
	<li>Freeing up an organization’s internal IT staff from performing user’s Level I help desk support requests so that they can work on more value-added and strategic projects for the organization</li>
	<li>24X7 coverage and improved responsiveness and service levels</li>
</ul>

		<title>Ask SWC: How Will SharePoint Make My Business More Efficient?</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/how-will-sharepoint-make-my-business-more-efficient</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have a lot of clients that come to us asking about the benefits of <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Solutions" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> and how they can utilize the platform to make their businesses run more efficiently. Watch my recent episode of “<a title="Ask SWC Video Blogs" href="/blog/category/ask-swc">Ask SWC</a>” to learn more about how Microsoft SharePoint can make your business more efficient.

<a title="Business Efficiency Through SharePoint" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OTFTDStudpo?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="SQL Server 2014 New BI Features" width="474" height="262" /></a>

One challenge that many organizations struggle with is how to convert their worker’s experience and knowledge into organizational knowledge. Most organizations have a lot of key people doing great things for the business and documenting those efforts. Let’s say one of these key people decides to go on an extended vacation or unfortunately moves on from the company one day. How does an organization actually reuse the information that they have created?

<a title="Microsoft SharePoint 2013" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-2013">Microsoft SharePoint</a> is a powerful productivity platform and market leading collaboration, search and content management solution. The product serves as a great place for users to organize projects, manage information and share their work with others. This is done by building repositories of information and categorizing and creating metadata. Then using SharePoint’s search capabilities, individual users are able to find exactly what they want when they want it. This eliminates time wasted continually bothering key people in the organization to ask questions like, “Hey Joe, can you send me this file or get this document back to me?” Users can just go to SharePoint, type in the keywords they want, find what they are looking for and move on with their day.

Microsoft SharePoint helps organizations overcome huge challenges by making sure everyone knows where the information they need is at all times, further enabling them to work faster, smarter and more efficiently than ever before.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="System Center App Controller" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/virtual-machine-manager-app-controller">Microsoft System Center App Controller 2012 R2</a> (SCAC) provides a unified self-service experience across both an organization’s private and public clouds to empower application owners to easily build, configure, deploy and manage new services. Read my blog to learn more about how this powerful tool will enable your organization to drastically reduce the time, complexity and costs associated with managing today’s fast paced IT environment.

By integrating Microsoft System Center Application Controller (SCAC) into your <a title="System Center Virtual Machine Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/virtual-machine-manager-app-controller">Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager</a> (SCVMM) you can significantly reduce both hardware and resource costs. The user permissions, applications, templates, networking and storage tiers available in SCVMM are also accessible in a secure SCAC web portal. Let’s say your organization has a hybrid configuration of an on-premise deployment with several VMs running in the Windows Azure cloud. SCAC can access resources in both locations, even if they are on disparate network segments. All your IT administrator needs to do is grant the application owner appropriate rights to perform a defined set of functions, such as the ability to checkpoint or reboot a VM. Furthermore, if that application owner wants to delegate some of these responsibilities to a subordinate, but with extra restrictions – such as not being allowed to delete or power-off the VM – he or she can do so using SCAC without having to involve IT at all.

By incorporating SCAC into the rest of the Microsoft System Center suite, you provide tenants with many more options. Using the scenario I described above, let’s say the same application owner uses the Microsoft System Center Service Manager portal to request new resources for his or her private cloud, and then fills in all of the necessary details, such as storage requirements and network connectivity. Service Manager will then emails this request to the appropriate IT administrator, who can reply to Service Manager and approve the request. Without even opening the Service Manager console, this email kicks off an Orchestrator runbook which automatically provisions the resources – locally or in the cloud – then grants permissions to the owner and sends a notification email once the setup has been completed. The new resource is now visible to the owner the next time they login to SCAC.

In this scenario, it is easy to see the vast potential for <a title="Chicago IT Services" href="http://www.swc.com">IT service</a> automation with SCAC. Although the tools are easy to use, architecting and implementing all of the details required to make SCAC successful can be complex. It takes a lot of planning and follow through. At SWC we work with many organizations to make optimized IT delivery a reality.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As <a title="Cloud Computing" href="/solutions/cloud-services">the cloud</a> becomes a more of realistic technology for many companies these days, there are a lot of concerns regarding privacy and compliance. Watch my “Ask SWC” video to learn more about how SWC can make the cloud a reality for organizations with privacy needs.

<a title="Privacy And The Cloud" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YOGC09y5fyU?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="SQL Server 2014 New BI Features" width="474" height="262" /></a>

The cloud continues to become a more realistic technology for many organizations now a days and a lot of our clients are asking us how to get there. But they also have a lot of concerns around privacy, compliance and users with items like PCI Security Standards and HIPPA Privacy Rules. At SWC we not only help our customers get to the cloud, but we also provide them with advisory services to help them understand the best way to leverage for their organization. For instance, is the right solution moving things like email and SharePoint to the cloud and retaining the rest of an organization’s infrastructure on-premise? Or maybe it’s putting an organization’s big data and business intelligence in the cloud with solutions like Power BI and Office 365.

SWC is a <a title="Technology Solutions Provider" href="http://www.swc.com">technology solutions provider</a> focused on understanding our client’s needs and designing the right cloud based solution that will benefit their organization by:
<ul>
	<li>Decreasing their technology infrastructure annual spend</li>
	<li>Improving availability of their applications and service</li>
	<li>Increasing the response time of their applications and network</li>
	<li>Extending applications that exist in their environments to delivery systems in the Cloud</li>
</ul>
For more information on how SWC can help move your organization to the cloud, please attend our upcoming <a title="Cloud Events Chicago" href="/events">Chicagoland cloud event</a> or connect with <a title="Jeremy Alt LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jeremy-alt/18/a97/7a6" target="_blank">Jeremy Alt on LinkedIn</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you check out the photo in this blog I took of my desk today you will notice that things have gotten a little out of hand. That’s because my desk is covered with many different types of IP phones optimized for Microsoft Lync that I use for client demonstrations and testing purposes. There are nine phones in this photo but for those of you who have attended our past <a title="Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications</a> events, you know there are at least 30 different IP phones that are optimized for Lync to choose from, in addition to many USB devices and peripherals (check out the following link for more information about these Lync optimized devices: <a href="http://www.optimizedfor.com" target="_blank">www.optimizedfor.com</a>).

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13101" title="Which Lync Phone Should I Use" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/which-lync-phone-should-i-use.png" alt="Which Lync Phone Should I Use" width="500" height="336" />

The point is when someone asks me which <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> device I prefer, there are a lot of options to choose from. To be honest there are many different vendors and different phones I like and recommend, based on an organization’s particular environment and telephony needs. I have included a few of my favorites for you below:
<h2>Polycom VVX 500:</h2>
At the moment, the device I use the most and my personal favorite is the Polycom VVX 500 in the photo with the sidecar (Polycom VVX Color Expansion Model). This particular device was designed for a broad range of UC environments and according to Polycom, it integrates with more IP PBX systems than any other business media phone in the industry. It is also very intuitive, easy-to-use and perfect for knowledge workers and busy managers.
<h2>Polycom CX600:</h2>
The second IP phone for Microsoft Lync that I would recommend is the Polycom CX600. This is a longtime favorite phone of mine and it’s been a solid workhorse. The Polycom CX600 is cost-effective and fully featured with HD voice technology and a large color display for on-screen presence. It is also perfect for workers in cubicles.
<h2>AudioCodes 440HD:</h2>
My brand new toy, which I am currently playing with is the AudioCodes 440HD. This device is a high-end executive IP Lync compatible phone. I will provide everyone with more details on how great the AudioCodes 440HD is in future blog series after I have spent some more time with the device.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been working in <a title="Business Intelligence Solutions" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a> and data warehousing environments for more than 20 years and over the last couple of weeks I have been evaluating a tool called XLCubed. Watch my “Ask SWC” video to learn more about XLCubed and its ability to create powerful reports through Microsoft Excel.

<a title="Business Intelligence - XLCubed Add-in Tool For Microsoft Excel" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lIuWHl01mkA?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="SQL Server 2014 New BI Features" width="474" height="262" /></a>

XLCubed is an add-in tool for Microsoft Excel that allows you to point to analysis and services cubes or any other relational databases so that you can create ad hoc analysis, reporting and even dashboards that can be published to the web with a single click. Once you put items on the web, the environments are the same, which is really cool because the user interactivity and use of the report on the web and in Microsoft Excel is the same.

Another reason I like XLCubed is because the tool extends the normal analysis services add-in that users get with Microsoft Excel, allowing you to create your own custom reporting. This adds a lot of features and functions and even visualizations to your business intelligence environment. XLCubed also removes some of the limitations and restrictions that are often encountered in Microsoft Excel, so that you can create what you want as you need it.

If you watch my “<a title="Ask SWC Video Blogs" href="/blog/category/ask-swc">Ask SWC</a>” video, you will see a demo of XLCubed. The first feature I show in the demo is cube aware calculations. Typically when I am creating a report in Microsoft Excel using an analysis services cube and I put a calculation at the end, once I drill into my data, chances are it would remove and overwrite that calculation. In the video, you will see that I created a normal Microsoft Excel calculation with an IF Statement and a little subtraction and then when I drill down into it, it copies that profit calculation all the way down and even across. As I drill into years, you can see that profit is brought over into each one of these pieces. This is the cube aware piece and if you drill into it, it will show you how the calculation is created in the MDX.

The second thing I want to show you, which I think is really cool, is if I have a bunch of things like the plants I am selling in the demo, I can create a graph that includes a four year trend of each type of plant. As you can see at the bottom of my demo screen, the graph quickly becomes very crowded. What XLCubed allows is a visualization where you can create an in-cell chart or spark line that shows you at a glance how each individual plant is doing over the last four years. I can now show you which ones are doing well and which ones aren’t doing so well.

Next I want to chat about small multiples, which is another cool thing that I really like. XLCubed allows you to plot multiple measures over different axises and dimensions. On the left hand side of my demo screen, I have an all dimension. If I drill into this dimension, it breaks my data down into all of the details of how each student group sold each plant.

Finally, when I publish this report to the web, there are a number of different visualizations that XLCubed offers, such as the slicers where you can pick the states or quarters or even the categories by clicking on these little radio buttons here and as you do, it updates all of the graphs and charts that go with it. In my demo, if I change from New York to Florida, you can see that the chart over on the right hand side has changed and now we have a graph of Florida. These charts are built on Google maps, so you can zoom in and zoom out. You can even change the view to a satellite view. The report itself, then draws these little bubbles there, so you can see the relative importance of the sales in each of these bubbles. The bigger the bubble, the more sales are there. If you’re wondering why I am talking about plants and bands, I will tell you that this data comes from a plant sale that my wife and I orchestrated for our high school band.

That’s a quick overview of XLCubed. We just scratched the surface of the tool’s capabilities in this demo. There are a lot more features and functions to see that we can help you with at SWC.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="System Center Service Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/service-manager">Microsoft System Center Service Manager 2012 R2</a> (SCSM) provides flexible self-service experiences and standardized datacenter processes that can help integrate people, workflows and knowledge across enterprise infrastructure and applications. Read my blog to learn more about the many benefits of Microsoft System Center Service Manager and how it can be used as a complete help desk solution for your organization.

One of the great things about Microsoft System Center Service Manager 2012 R2 (SCSM) is its ability to provide flexible self-service experiences and standardized data center processes. By using an IT Governance, Risk and Compliance (IT-GRC) Pack, IT managers can formalize certain processes to facilitate Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practices. SCSM also consumes data generated by other <a title="Microsoft System Center Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center</a> products to generate IT help desk incidents, trend on problems, report statistics and offer services based upon the needs of an organization.

SCSM can serve as an integration hub, allowing user-driven Configuration Items (CIs) to be gathered via deployed agents and multiple connectors can be created into other products to extend SCSM. This streamlines alert channels across the entire Microsoft System Center suite, to meet designated SLOs and SLAs. For example, the <a title="Microsoft Exchange Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Microsoft Exchange</a> Server Connector provides an additional layer of support options by allowing IT staff to respond to and address incidents and close cases by using keywords, without even needing to open the SCSM console! <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013 Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> integration is also provided in-box for IM and presence so that help desk staff can communicate with end-users in real time for support incidents, with all activities logged and timed for managers to review. Finally, the Active Directory connector pulls all associated user, computer and printer objects, further reducing the need to re-enter or track down technical information.

In more complex situations, <a title="SCSM Consulting Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/service-manager">SCSM</a> can designate levels of urgency and initiate escalation if a larger problem has been detected or an SLA has been breached. Let’s say that ten incident tickets come into SCSM from different users, saying that they cannot access their files. An analyst realizes that all these files are located on the same server and thus identifies a cause – the file server must be down. The analysis can then group all of these incidents together, linking them under the root problem and assign it to the server administrator. Users can also keep track of the incident updates via the Microsoft SharePoint portal and once the server is fixed, the server administrator can then mark the problem as resolved, which triggers an automated cascade to notify affected users that access has been restored and close all related alerts in Microsoft System Center Operations Manager.

When you combine all of these actions with the self-service <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Solutions" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> portal plug-in, you’ve got a complete help desk management solution. SWC can also help your organization deploy and customize Microsoft SharePoint, or get all of the analytical data I described out of Microsoft SQL Server. Our Software Solutions group has vast experience writing SharePoint plug-ins and developing SQL Server business intelligence solutions. We also offer <a title="Managed IT Service Provider" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">Managed IT Services</a> to monitor and maintain it all.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mainstream support for many <a title="Microsoft System Center" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">Microsoft System Center</a> 2007 products end on Tuesday, July 8, 2014. What does that mean for organizations using System Center 2007? Read my blog to learn more.

On July 8, 2014 Microsoft will end mainstream support for many System Center 2007 products. If your organization has System Center 2007 deployed, this means you will need to purchase an extended support agreement in order to get any non-security updates. If you are still using Microsoft System Center 2007 products, the end of mainstream support is a great time to consider moving to <a title="System Center 2012 R2" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/microsoft-system-center-2012-r2">Microsoft System Center 2012 R2</a>.

SWC has a wealth of experience and deep technical expertise in the Microsoft System Center 2012 R2 stack, allowing us to help our customers enable their business and users.

		<title>Keeping Active Directory Clean Keeps Exchange, Lync and SharePoint Lean and Mean!</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/unified-communications/active-directory-clean-keeps-exchange-lync-sharepoint-lean-mean</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s going to be a hot summer and if you haven’t done your spring cleaning, I would suggest you start with Active Directory. Read my blog to learn how keeping your Active Directory clean keeps your <a title="Microsoft Exchange Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Microsoft Exchange</a>, <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Lync</a> and <a title="Microsoft SharePoint Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a> environments lean and mean.

I can’t tell you how many times in my career I have seen companies scramble to put out a fire that could have been prevented by simply maintaining their Active Directory environment. Business critical applications such as Microsoft Exchange, Lync and SharePoint rely heavily on Active Directory and when it’s not healthy, they aren’t either. How do I check my Active Directory? That’s a good question!

Here are some easy ways that you can check to see if your Active Directory is running smoothly:
<h2>BPA Free?</h2>
Yes…as in Microsoft Best Practice Analyzer! You can use the Microsoft BPA to check things like Active Directory DS and DNS on your Domain Controller and it’s built into Windows Server 2008 R2 through the most recent version, Windows Server 2012 R2.

For more information on Microsoft Best Practice Analyzer, check out the following link from Microsoft: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766042.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd392255(v=ws.10).aspx</a>
<h2>DCDiag</h2>
You should be running this very helpful tool once a week on your Domain Controllers. The DCDiag tool allows you to verify the overall well-being of your Domain Controllers.

For more information about DCDiag, check out the following link from Microsoft:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731968.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731968.aspx</a>
<h2>Event Viewer</h2>
Your Event Viewer logs are not supposed to be on Fire! I can’t tell you how many times I have gone into a customer’s environment to fix an issue and when I look at their Domain Controller Event logs, they are on fire. Event Viewer logs are a simple indicator that something is wrong within your Active Directory environment. You should not be seeing a bunch of red in there.

For more information about Event Viewer and Logs, check out the following link from Microsoft:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766042.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766042.aspx</a>
<h2>Forest / Domain Time</h2>
What time is it? Hopefully all of you domain controllers in the whole Forest can give the same answer. A proper time source is very important for your overall Active Directory Health. When Domain Controllers are out of sync with each other very bad things can happen including authentication and permission problems. Another thing people often do not consider is that when you have a virtual environment such as VMware you should NOT synchronize your Domain Controllers to the VM Host. You should always use the PDCe in the Forest.

For more information about Windows Time, check out the following link from Microsoft:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc816712(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc816712(v=ws.10).aspx</a>
Remember that you cannot take the “set it and forget it” approach to Active Directory! Keeping your Active Directory healthy is critical to keeping your Microsoft Exchange, Lync and SharePoint environments running smoothly.

		<title>SWC Helps Tandem HR Be More Productive Using Microsoft Lync</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tandem HR turned to SWC when they needed a telephony solution that would help make their employees more productive on the road and in the office. We deployed <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a>. Watch our client success video case study to learn more.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RO7rllyZ2wA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0" rel="shadowbox;width=720;height=480;"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/tandem-hr-microsoft-lync-managed-services-solution.jpg" alt="Microsoft Lync Managed Services Solution Tandem HR" width="500" height="281" /></a>

Tandem HR is a professional employment organization and an outsourced solution for clients in the areas of benefits, payroll, human resources, risk, employee assistance programs and more. The internal IT team at Tandem HR is responsible for making sure employees have seamless communications and seamless network functionality, so that their resources are 100% at their hands whether they are in the office, remote, at a client’s site, or even working from home. The IT team wants to make sure that they have those services available so that they can effectively do their jobs.

Before SWC deployed Microsoft Lync, getting a voicemail required being in the office or Tandem HR employees had to dial into their desk phones to get a voicemail. After the transition to Microsoft Lync, the organization feels like they have been significantly more productive with this product installed in their system. Now all of their voicemails are delivered directly to their email inbox and can be easily accessed with the click of a button. Tandem HR also likes the additional tools and capabilities they receive with Microsoft Lync for presentations, white boarding, instant messaging and polling. They use all of it. Tandem HR can now go live instantly using Microsoft Lync’s audio and video conferencing functionality.
After deploying Microsoft Lync, Tandem HR also engaged SWC for <a title="Microsoft Lync Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/microsoft-lync-managed-services">Microsoft Lync Managed Services</a>, which allows us to assume responsibility and proactively monitor, manage and support their Microsoft Lync environment on a 24x7 basis. We also update and manage their systems to ensure the stability, security and the functionality their environment.

SWC worked with Tandem HR’s internal IT team to install Microsoft Lync over the weekend. When employees walked into the office on Monday morning, everything was working perfectly. The solution now serves as a telephony platform and voice alternative for the organization. Since Tandem HR already uses the Microsoft stack, little training was needed for employees on how to use Lync, as the product fully integrates into solutions like Microsoft SharePoint and Exchange and is very intuitive.

		<title>PSA:  Microsoft Ends Mainstream Support for SQL Server 2008 R2</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sql-server/microsoft-ends-support-sql-server-2008-r2</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Warning! If you are on Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 or earlier, you may have entered the Microsoft world of “the end of mainstream support.” What does that mean for organizations using SQL Server 2008 R2? Read my blog to learn more.

Unfortunately, mainstream support has already ended for Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and on July 8, 2014 Microsoft also ended mainstream support for SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2. Microsoft offers mainstream support for five years after a product’s release or two years after the successor product. This means <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL Server 2012</a> is now a healthy two-year-old product.

When Microsoft ends a product’s mainstream support, they are removing all warranty claims, no-charge incident support and any design changes or feature requests. Extended support for SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2 is still available, but it will cost you. If your organization is still using these products in your SQL environment, you will need to be on the latest service pack. Are you on the latest service packs?

SWC can help you navigate these confusing waters and also review your SQL environment to identify the risks. We can also help support and improve your SQL environment through our <a title="Virtual Database Administrator Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/virtual-dba">Virtual Database Administrator</a> or VDBA solution offering. Call us today to learn more about how we can improve your organization’s SQL systems and plan the right migration path to the next generation of SQL server. Are you ready for SQL 2012 or SQL2014? Take our free preliminary <a title="Free SQL Server Assessment" href="/solutions/managed-services/virtual-dba/database-assessment">SQL Server assessment</a> to see how SWC can help you plan the next phase of your SQL life.

		<title>Migrating From Standalone Exchange Online Protection (EOP) to Office 365</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/unified-communications/migrating-exchange-online-protection-office-365</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2014 11:02:25 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[unifiedcommunications]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.swc.com/?p=13382</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is Microsoft’s offering in the hosted email security space. While Microsoft Exchange Server is the global standard in on-premise business email, their cloud-based EOP service provides spam, virus and malware protection for end-users. Although the platform has gone through several rebrands and changes since being acquired by Microsoft from FrontBridge Technologies in 2005, it most recently replaced Forefront Online Protection for Exchange (FOPE) in 2013. Read my blog to learn more.

Recently, many mid-market businesses have been looking to migrate from their on-premise <a title="Microsoft Exchange Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-exchange-2013">Microsoft Exchange</a> environment to Office 365 and Microsoft Exchange Online for email. These solutions can help reduce their infrastructure footprint and minimize the maintenance overhead from running a redundant email platform in-house by shifting that responsibility to Microsoft. Exchange Online Protection is built-in and included, free of charge to each Office 365 e-mail user. This provides for the same enterprise-class spam and virus protection after migration to the cloud. However, the presence of a pre-existing standalone EOP subscription enhances the need for careful planning and expertise during the discovery phase of your email migration.

Recently, <a title="SWC Technology Partners" href="http://www.swc.com">SWC Technology Partners</a> completed an Office 365 email migration for one of our <a title="Chicago Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services">managed services</a> clients in which their source environment was protected by Exchange Online Protection. This client receives over 30,000 inbound messages daily, so maintaining and protecting their email environment is business-critical. Despite sharing an administrative portal login interface, Exchange Online Protection and Office 365 cannot co-exist under the same domain name. Largely because of the various back-end Receive connectors needed to properly filter email messages for spam, unfortunately there is <strong>not</strong> a straightforward method for moving a domain name between accounts. Thus, during our project planning, we determined the following steps to be necessary:
<ol>
	<li>Establish an after-hours maintenance window and change inbound mail flow (MX records) to bypass Exchange Online Protection, routing mail directly to the Exchange Server for a brief period.</li>
	<li>After DNS has fully propagated, decommission the EOP tenant account and allow each domain name to be removed from Microsoft’s system.</li>
	<li>Initialize the Office 365 tenant account and perform domain verification.</li>
	<li>Immediately set up a hybrid coexistence (with directory synchronization of user objects between Active Directory and Office 365) in Exchange Server and configure the appropriate routing connectors in Office 365 to begin syncing objects for spam protection.</li>
	<li>Re-route inbound mail flow to point at Office 365 for spam protection for all mailboxes, even while they still reside on the Exchange Server.</li>
	<li>Finally, we can begin the process of mailbox moves into Office 365 Exchange Online.</li>
</ol>
The nature of our multi-competency Microsoft Gold Partnership underscores the technical expertise that SWC’s infrastructure engineers maintain in <a title="Office 365" href="/blog/unified-communications/why-swc-it-departments-like-office-365">Office 365</a> and many other cloud technologies. Through a multi-phased approach that includes a network health evaluation and discovery, along with careful project planning, our goal is to make your Office 365 migration as smooth as possible. SWC has deep and diverse experience completing migrations from a wide array of platforms, not limited to just Exchange Server. The next time you are looking for a partner to handle your email migration, give SWC a call.To learn more about planning your migration path to Microsoft Exchange, please join us for our next complimentary <a title="Unified Communications Events" href="/events">Unified Communications event</a>.

Watch my best practices video to learn more about why partnering with an <a title="Managed IT Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">IT managed services provider</a> is a best practice for many mid-market organizations.

<a title="Managed IT Services Best Practices: Outsourcing Service Desk" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pDSInnxHXaQ?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/susie-cummings-managed-it-services-video-player.png" alt="Managed IT Services Video" width="400" height="281" /></a>

I’ve had a lot of conversations lately with C-level executives who are frustrated with all of the IT surprises their organizations continue to face. They are tired of coming into work and learning that the organization’s email has been down or stopped working one evening and there was no one around to get it fixed after hours. Many executives are also trying to understand how IT can be an enabler for their business. I think this is due to the fact that there has been a lot of press recently around the cloud and products like O365 and other technologies from Microsoft that allow companies to have that “always on” capability. I continue to hear that C-level executives in many organizations are struggling to figure out and calculate the value they are getting from IT.

Keeping up has always been one of the greatest challenges internal IT teams face in the mid-market. There is increased complexity, in terms of the size of a mid-market company’s IT environment and the technologies that are running within those organizations. As a result, an organization’s IT spend continues to increase. When there are outages or problems, a CFO or CEO is going to start to challenge why an internal IT department needs to make a larger investment, hire another IT person, or purchase a new technology.

I know the C-level executives in these mid-market organizations are trying to figure out what the right solution is and at SWC, these IT conversations are easy to have. When we start to lay out the <a title="IT Services" href="http://www.swc.com">IT services</a> and solutions SWC can provide from a <a title="Chicago Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services">Managed Services</a> standpoint that will help supplement their internal IT teams, the conversation quickly changes from having to hire another IT person, to asking SWC to deliver that work at a fraction of a cost.There are many benefits to partnering with a managed IT services provider like SWC to complement your internal team or completely outsourcing IT operations to, including:
<ul>
	<li>Leveraging a team of more 150 experienced and highly qualified Chicagoland consultants and engineers to help monitor, track and repair any IT challenge – 24x7</li>
	<li>Implementing industry best practices for high IT environment performance and reliability</li>
	<li>Developing infrastructure strategies and roadmaps to support business goals and drive business impact</li>
	<li>Breadth and depth of experience in all of the complementary technologies necessary for mid-market business operations – including software, infrastructure and security services</li>
</ul>

		<title>Anthony’s Review: Lync 2013 and the Grandstream GXV3275</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Grandstream GXV3275 is unlike any other Lync phone I have come across or had the chance to play with. It is essentially an Android tablet turned into a desk phone with a large touch screen, built-in video camera and various apps. Read my blog to learn more about some of the cool features of the Grandstream GXV3275 Microsoft Lync phone.

The Grandstream GXV3275 is an Android tablet turned into a desk phone. It has a 7″ or 1024×600 capacitive (5 points) touch screen TFT LCD. However, unlike your traditional Microsoft Lync phone, the Grandstream GXV3275 doesn’t run the Microsoft Lync Phone Edition firmware or have a specific customized firmware for <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a>. The Grandstream GXV3275 runs a version of Android, which is specialized and hosts multiple VoIP apps including the app for Lync Mobile.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13416" title="Microsoft Lync Phone Grandstream 1" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Grandstream1.png" alt="Microsoft Lync Phone Grandstream 1" width="500" height="336" />

One of the first things you will notice about the Grandstream GXV3275 is its large, bright touch screen – an amazing feature! There is a video camera built-in the phone, right above that large touch screen with a toggle on the back. This toggle gives you the ability to adjust the video camera’s position, so it can point directly at you. Of course, in my mind one of the best parts about this video camera is that it works great with Microsoft Lync 2013!

Another great feature of the Grandstream GXV3275 is the limitless customization options available – from setting a background to choosing one of the millions of screensavers available – it’s very easy to swipe from one screen to another and install one of the built-in GS Market store’s apps. The Grandstream GXV3275 also gives you the ability to connect directly to the Google Play store for apps, which I think is pretty cutting edge. The customization options available combined with the Grandstream GXV3275’s giant touch screen has made this phone the single most asked about phone in my LCS, OCS and Lync tenure. And, that’s saying a lot since I have nine other Lync 2013 compatible phones sitting on my desk at the moment (Refer to Anthony’s past post: <a title="Which Lync Phone" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/unified-communications/which-lync-phone-should-i-use">http://www.swc.com/blog/unified-communications/which-lync-phone-should-i-use</a>).

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13416" title="Microsoft Lync Phone Grandstream 2" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Grandstream2.png" alt="Microsoft Lync Phone Grandstream 2" width="500" height="336" />

Another Grandstream GXV3275 feature that has really stuck out in my mind is networking. The Grandstream GXV3275 has your traditional VoIP phone gigabit port with the pass-through you would expect on the back to run on PoE. However, the Grandstream GXV3275 can also run Wi-Fi, making it the perfect phone to use in a home office. The Grandstream GXV3275 can also support six different lines. In addition to running Microsoft Lync, the Grandstream GXV3275 also runs a variety of VoIP apps for Android. As you can see from a photo I took below, I have one line loaded up on the Grandstream GXV3275, but I can simply make a call using a different line by touching the left side of the screen where the different line is and dialing the number.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13416" title="Microsoft Lync Phone Grandstream 3" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Grandstream3.png" alt="Microsoft Lync Phone Grandstream 3" width="500" height="336" />

The Grandstream GXV3275 also gives you the full Microsoft Lync mobile app experience you would expect.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13416" title="Microsoft Lync Phone Grandstream 4" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Grandstream4.png" alt="Microsoft Lync Phone Grandstream 4" width="500" height="336" />

There are so many possibilities with the Grandstream GXV3275 tablet experience. By having access to the apps on your phone, all of your data is kept at your fingertips. I can use the Grandstream GXV3275 to access critical software like Salesforce right on my desk phone. The phone is also competitively priced at about $300 – a great price for this unit.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13416" title="Microsoft Lync Phone Grandstream 5" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Grandstream5.png" alt="Microsoft Lync Phone Grandstream 5" width="500" height="336" />

While I have gone on and on about all of the positive features of the Grandstream GXV3275, unfortunately there are some negative things about the phone I have to tell you. It's biggest strength is also it's biggest weakness. The Grandstream GXV3275 runs the Microsoft Lync Mobile client which means there are some serious functionality limitations. One of those limitations is LIS services or emergency notification services support – i.e. 911. I suggest checking out this recent article on Microsoft Tech net that discusses some of the response group participation limitations before purchasing this phone: <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh691004.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh691004.aspx</a>

The team behind the Grandstream GXV3275 continues to work closely with the team at Microsoft to further develop Lync 2013 integration. So we will have to stand by and see how the Grandstream GXV3275 will continue to evolve and become the perfect fit for many organizations using Microsoft Lync 2013.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Managed by <a title="Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/configuration-manager-sccm">Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager</a> (SCCM), Endpoint Protection 2012 R2 (SCEP) provides industry-leading threat detection of malware and exploits. As part of a unified infrastructure for managing client security and compliance, SCEP helps simplify and improve antivirus management via an integrated console and tools. Combined with SWC’s Managed Security Services, SCEP can help protect your organization from today’s cyber threats. Read my blog to learn more.

Microsoft System Center Endpoint Protection or SCEP is <a href="https://www.icsalabs.com/vendor/microsoft-corporation" target="_blank">ICSA Labs certified</a>. The product reports on virus activity through a console dashboard in <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL Server</a> Reporting Services. One of the great things about SCEP is the support for Windows XP has been extended past its date of expiration (Read Jeremy’s blog to learn more: <a title="Windows XP Anti-Malware Extension" href="/blog/ask-swc/what-does-microsofts-windows-xp-anti-malware-extension-mean">What Does Microsoft’s Windows XP Anti-Malware Extension Mean</a>?). This means that while there will be no more OS-level patches written for Windows XP, antivirus engines and definitions will continue to be provided. This will help organizations that may need more time in completing their migrations to newer versions of the Windows OS. Antivirus agents for Linux and Mac clients are also available through SCEP and can be installed without System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM). However, we suggest using SCCM because this takes away from central management and policies become static rather than dynamic.

Another cool thing about SCEP is that there are multiple sources for definition updates available, even offline, including SCCM, WSUS and MSFT. A <a title="System Center Operations Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/operations-manager-scom">System Center Operations Manager</a> Management Pack is available for integration, so that antivirus incidents can generate alerts. Windows Defender can also be an option to use as a fallback antivirus and deployment can be automated via SCCM. The antivirus driver supports ODX and respects CPU limits. For those using Windows Intune in a cloud-only configuration, a version of the endpoint agent is provided.

While we really like SCEP and it is one of our favorite Microsoft System Center tools, we know that there are many things an organization needs to do to keep their environment safe and secure. We continue to see a lot more mid-market and SMB clients getting infected by malware such as the CrytoLocker virus, which usually shows up as email spam. That’s why we tell our clients that security is not just one thing or product, its a mindset. You need products like SCEP in conjunction with the right tools and tactics. SWC offers Security assessments and penetration testing to help mid-market organizations protect their environments from today’s next generation security threats and stay ahead of the bad guys.

		<title>The Technology Surrounding My Internship at SWC</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve had a few internships in the past, but none have been like my experience at SWC Technology Partners. I’ve learned the true meaning of professionalism and the phrase “work hard, play hard.” I’ve also realized that SWC’s products and services relate very closely to everything I’ve grown to understand about the business world. Here’s a few things I’ve learned:
<h2>Unified Communications</h2>
One of the first products I was introduced to at SWC was <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a>; a <a title="Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications</a> platform used for online meetings, audio and video conferencing, instant messaging and voice calling. What I learned is that I should be more like Lync! Don’t be afraid to communicate with everyone around you. Make connections and get to know the people who you work with directly and those who you may never work on a project with. It is important to understand the organization as a whole, rather than just your own department. The only way to do this is through communication.
<h2>Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</h2>
After being introduced to <a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM" href="/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a>, I can’t imagine how a company would succeed without it. Logging your connections with current and future clients and keeping them organized is key for success. I’ve learned that you should also keep your own personal CRM system… aka LinkedIn. Everyone you meet at your internship is a portal for connections in the future. Collecting colleagues’ business cards or adding them on LinkedIn will help you keep track of everyone you meet and help you succeed down the road when you are looking for future opportunities.
<h2>Microsoft SharePoint</h2>
<a title="Microsoft SharePoint Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">Microsoft SharePoint</a> is a place to share, organize and discover information. It can be intimidating at times to speak up in a business meeting or to present an idea to a supervisor, but it is so important to share your ideas and collaborate with others! If you don’t think you are ready to share your idea, write it down. Having your thoughts and ideas on paper or your computer screen allows you to go back to them when you are ready to share.
<h2>Digital Marketing</h2>
I’ve learned a lot about <a title="Digital Marketing Services" href="/solutions/digital-marketing">Digital Marketing</a> from my internship. Branding, designing, SEO, videography and social media are extremely important in today’s digital landscape. Remember, even as an intern, that you are creating your own brand too. Make sure that every day you show up to the office you are displaying something that you are proud of. Whether that be your outfit, your attitude or the work you turn into your manager. Brand yourself. Be creative. When people search your name on the internet or ask around about you, make sure what they find is positive information and a great image.
<h2>Managed IT Services</h2>
SWC’s <a title="Managed IT Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">Managed IT Services</a> offering provides our clients with 24/7 monitoring, management and support of any IT challenge. Your manager is not much different. Always remember that your managers or supervisors are there to help you and guide you with your internship experience. They want it to go just as smoothly as you do. Questions, concerns, challenges? Express these to your manager. They’re on your side and ready to support you!

I’m very thankful for my experience at SWC. I encourage you to think of these and get excited when you’re applying for internships. This is your opportunity to not only learn about your career, but learn about yourself. Whether you’re looking for an internship or a full-time position, SWC is a great place to build your career.

		<title>Ask SWC: How Can You Protect Your Organization From An IT Security Breach?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The bad guys are winning as today's cyber threats have evolved past our current security solutions. Watch my “Ask SWC” video to learn more about the recent security threats that corporations like PF Chang’s and Target have suffered and how you can protect your organization from a security breach.

<a title="FireEye Security Protection" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ajjJWDE6WeQ?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Ask SWC Technology Partners" width="474" height="262" /></a>

On June 9th a large bunch of credit cards were posted on an online fraud site. Almost immediately after they were posted, credit card companies started detecting fraudulent activity was happening on these cards. They then looked into what all of the commonalities were on these cards and what they found was that every credit card had been used at a PF Chang’s branch. Fast forward to today and PF Chang’s has actually disclosed that thirty three of their restaurants were hit by this cyber-attack. The PF Chang’s attack looks like a lot of other security breaches we have seen in the past, such as the Target security breach, where credit card numbers were stolen and posted on an online site.

The big question is, what can your organization do to protect yourself from a security breach and this type of malware? Traditional signature based antivirus software is no longer effective at detecting these types of attacks and other security threats such as botnets and Crypto-Locker. What you should be using is behavioral based protection to keep your organization safe. The leader in this space is FireEye, a next generation threat protection platform that stops advanced malware and zero-day attacks. FireEye does this by running the malware in a virtual environment and looks for any type of malicious activity a payload may do. FireEye even detected the Target attack before any of the data was stolen, but what most people don’t know is that Target failed to respond to the alerts – a billion dollar mistake!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you experienced problems with Lync client logins and choppy or jittery audio/video quality after deploying <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> Online with your Office 365 subscription? An important part of using Lync Online service is knowing if there are any possible network performance issues. The Transport Reliability IP Probe (TRIPP) can assist with testing an Internet connection to a Microsoft Lync Online Service data center. Read my blog to learn more.

The (TRIPP) is a reliability tool that assists with testing a Microsoft Lync Online Service data center Internet connection. The tool measures allowed ports, bandwidth, response times, route taken and the overall connection quality for Real Time Media. This tool is not meant to be an “end all be all” compatibility check for Microsoft Lync Online services, but does provide insight to help diagnose or troubleshoot possible Internet connectivity issues from the client network.

TRIPP provides useful information by testing various aspects of a client’s connection to the Internet. The first category of tests will determine if the Lync client can reach Lync Online services using the required ports for functionality (login, federation, media and audio/video). A failure in this category does not necessarily reflect an issue with the Lync Online service but may be due to your network or security configuration on the client network. The ports tested by the tool are:
<ul>
	<li>Client Access TCP-443: Login to Lync Online Services</li>
	<li>Federation Access TCP-5061: Discovery and communication to others outside organization</li>
	<li>Media Access 3478 – UDP: Audio and video lower (50000 - UDP) and Upper (59999- UDP)</li>
</ul>
TRIPP will only test the audio and video port test (50000 and 59999 – UDP). If these are open and functional, it will assume the range in between is functional.

All of the other sections of tests performed by TRIPP focus on the quality of the Internet connection. A large amount of packet loss, poor download or upload speeds and/or delayed response rates can contribute to the quality of online meetings and communications. Lync clients will likely experience choppy or “jittery” media and audio/video due to these network issues. It is worthy to note that this can be more prevalent when a client is connected to a wireless network. The quality of the wireless connection plays a large factor in the media, audio and video experience.

TRIPP will provide a summary page at the completion of all the subcategories of the tests. Overall, it has been my experience that the consistency of service check is usually yellow or red for most tests. It can contradict itself with the results on the quality issues in the previous test categories (VOIP, speed and round trip time). I have found that if you focus on the overall quality of the data stream in these categories, it is most often the result of the chop or jitter in meetings and conferences.

Please keep the TRIPP tool in mind when you are faced with troubleshooting Internet connection problems with Lync clients to Microsoft Lync Online services. The tool can be accessed by choosing one of the locations closest to you in the links below. You will however need to update or install the latest version of Java to run TRIPP <strong>before clicking on the below links</strong>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Congratulations Microsoft! Microsoft has overtaken Cisco for the first time as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for <a title="Unified Communications Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications">Unified Communications</a>. This comes on the heels of other news such as Microsoft overtaking Cisco for Unified Communications sales in the first quarter of 2014. Watch my “Ask SWC” video to learn more.

<a title="Microsoft Lync Gartner Magic Quadrant" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DLKGfxo1R7Q?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Microsoft Lync Gartner Magic Quadrant" width="400" height="281" /></a>

We are all very excited that Gartner has positioned Microsoft as a Leader in its 2014 Magic Quadrant for Unified Communications. Of course, if you already use <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> like so many of us do, this probably comes as no surprise to you as Microsoft has been constantly improving the solution on premise and in the cloud. At <a title="IT Consulting Firm" href="http://www.swc.com">IT consulting firm</a>, SWC we like to think of Microsoft Unified Communications as a game changer in how our clients communicate, providing them enterprise-class telephony, email, audio and video conferencing and instant messaging through Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Lync.

A recap of some of the reasons Gartner named Microsoft a Leader in the 2014 Unified Communications Magic Quadrant this are:
<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Lync’s ability to meet the real-time communications needs of enterprise organizations</li>
	<li>The ability to phase a Microsoft Lync deployment, beginning with web conferencing, IM and presence and then incrementally adding telephony and video</li>
	<li>Microsoft Lync’s enhanced video capabilities (including HD video)</li>
	<li>The ability for users to more effectively perform tasks by integrating Microsoft Lync functions into business applications and processes</li>
</ul>

Many of our customers are also leveraging Microsoft Lync for voice and as their single Unified Communications platform. One of the big advantages of Microsoft Lync is the ability for our customers to take a staged deployment approach. Many times we recommend deploying Microsoft Lync for IM and presence first so users can get accustomed to its look and feel. Then we suggest adding in conferencing and even using Lync for voice as an alternative to their current PBX solution. These customers experience significant cost savings. Studies have shown a Unified Communications solution can save a 100-person organization up to $92,000 per year or reduce the unproductive time in an employee’s day spent trying to communicate (contact people, find information, schedule meetings and/or deal with unwanted communications) by 50%!

		<title>Ask SWC: What Are Some New Features of Tableau 8.2?</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/ask-swc/new-features-tableau-8-2</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are really excited about the launch of Tableau 8.2. The product’s new release has a lot of great features and updates that will help users more effectively discover and communicate <a title="Business Intelligence Consulting" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a> insights. Watch my “Ask SWC” video blog to learn more.

<a title="New Features of Tableau 8.2" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-tIqgX3gIrk?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="New Features of Tableau 8.2" width="474" height="262" /></a>

Tableau 8.2 has a lot of new and exciting features including map designs, story points, visual data windows and the ability to now run Tableau Desktop on a Mac. One of my favorite features is the new Tableau story points or storyboarding feature. The <a title="Business Intelligence Tableau" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/tableau">Tableau 8.2</a> storyboarding feature is a new and interactive way to create narratives of your business intelligence data without having to copy and paste all of your different reports and dashboards into different PowerPoint slides or other programs when you are presenting them to your stakeholders.

The Tableau 8.2 storyboarding feature allows users to build out a story. For example, if you have a new product line that you are launching to the market, the first slide of your story might be sales. For items like dollar amounts, you might want to use one of the Tableau business intelligence geography map tools to show sales across the U.S. or even different countries. Next you might want to show your marketing spend and how to tie that into sales, so you could go to the next frame of the story to show these insights. From there, you can build a new frame into the story to show the future sales pipeline. You can even use something like the statistical tool R to do trending on past sales or look at some predictive analytics to determine where that product line might go (watch Rachael’s past “Ask SWC” video blog on <a title="Tableau and R" href="/blog/ask-swc/what-is-the-new-r-feature-for-tableau-8-1">Tableau and R</a>).

The Tableau 8.2 storyboard feature can help your organization tell a story without having to pop in and out of different dashboards. The tool is also very interactive with your data and gives users the ability to refresh it in real-time, so someone can use it in your organization today and then three days later use it to see how the different trends, analysis and data has changed. Another great way to use the Tableau 8.2 storyboard tool would be for something repeatable like quarterly financials, where you would use the exact same storyboard and it would automatically change and refresh with new business intelligence data every 90 days.

I think the Tableau 8.2 storyboarding feature is beneficial to any organization and users will thoroughly enjoy the interactive insights and visualization it provides. The tool helps to tell a story without having to jump in and out of a lot of information. For data analysts and data scientists, the Tableau 8.2 storyboarding feature can help solve complicated and complex problems by taking a really complicated problem or data set and breaking it down into four or five storyboards and being able to walk everyone through the process. For instance, your organization could use the Tableau 8.2 storyboarding tool to explain why sales are down.

Another tool that we are excited about in Tableau 8.2 is the visual designer tool or visual data window for data relationships. In past versions of Tableau there was a little bit of a learning curve with the visual designer tool in regards to learning how to set up a relationship between one set of data and another. For instance, if you had some data in one server and some data in Oracle you would need to understand how to set up that relationship. Now with Tableau 8.2 the process is all visual, so you can set up full joins, right joins, left joins and any other data relationship joins you might expect, but now they are visual with an indicator of how the join works. The visual designer also gives users a sampling of what is going to happen when you make that join, so if you make a mistake it’s pretty easy to change your right join to a left join and vice versa to get it correct and validated. These are great features for someone who isn’t very technical to use.

To learn more about Tableau 8.2 and all of its great new features and functionally, please join us for our next complimentary business intelligence event, specifically our <a title="Chicago Business Intelligence Events" href="/events">Chicagoland event</a> on <strong>August 27th</strong> where we will be doing some new demos of the latest Tableau 8.2 release.<h3>Recommended Posts</h3>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Are there certain industries facing more security issues than others? Watch my best practices video to learn more about today’s security threats and what your organization can do to keep your data safe and stay ahead of the bad guys.

<a title="IT Security Best Practices - Which Industries Face Security Issues?" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BurBwEwjAIw?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/tommy-montgomery-swc-it-security-services-video-player.png" alt="IT Security Services Video" width="400" height="281" /></a>

People may think certain industries face more security issues than others, but that’s not really the case. There are security issues and risks facing every industry. Any organization that takes credit cards or has information that can be profited from is at risk for a security breach. We saw this a lot with the Target security breach, where attackers pulled credit card numbers and were then able to make a lot of money selling those numbers. Credit cards can be sold on card shops for $30 to $50 per card. It’s a big business!

Another problem we’ve seeing lately is that a lot of the Eastern European and Russian communities are starting to see organized crime where they are capitalizing on these types of security breaches as well and stealing credit card numbers and information as well. The big issue here is that they have the time and resources to dedicate to these activities. Security issues are no longer just in our backyard or a kid in a basement anymore, security breaches can happen anywhere in the world.

<strong>The numbers don’t lie…</strong>
<ul>
	<li>40% of corporate cyber-attacks are targeted at companies with 500 or less employees</li>
	<li>According to the FBI, every second 18 computers are infected by botnets</li>
	<li>33% of businesses said stolen data would hurt their credibility and result in severe financial impact</li>
	<li>90% of small businesses have permanently closed within two years of a cyber-attack; 60% have closed within six months</li>
	<li>The average data breach costs a company $3.5 million</li>
</ul>

		<title>Why Should I Upgrade to Microsoft Lync 2013?</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/unified-communications/why-upgrade-microsoft-lync-2013</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So you’re still running Microsoft Lync 2010 in your environment. Why not? Just because Microsoft comes out with a new version of a product, why should you upgrade? Read my blog on to learn more.

The upgrade argument has been heard in IT over and over again. It’s as old as dirt. What am I going to gain by upgrading? I want to know how it will benefit me. Well, here are few compelling reasons why your organization should definitely consider upgrading to <a title="Microsoft Lync 2013 Consulting" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync 2013</a>:
<h2>Conferencing Improvements</h2>
Wish you could see your coworkers in HD? Microsoft Lync Server 2013 now supports HD video. You can get up to 1080P resolution in both two-party and multi-party conferences. For video conferences with more than two people, users can see video of the other participants in the Gallery View. The new default video codec is H.264 SVC video. H.264 SVC video supports a greater range of resolutions and frame rates.
<h2>Lync Web App</h2>
Let’s face it, the Lync 2010 web app was good but it was limited. Enter the Lync 2013 Lync Web App! The Lync 2013 version of Lync Web App now has full Conference support with A/V! It makes it much easier for users without the Lync client to join a meeting via their browser with full audio and video. You now get the full Lync meeting experience which includes: HD video, VoIP, IM and desktop, application and PowerPoint sharing.

<h2>Persistent Chat</h2>
In Lync 2010 Persistent Chat was called Group Chat. You had to use a Group Chat Admin tool, a Group Chat Configuration Tool and your users had to access it with a separate client. It was a pain. That is not the case in Lync 2013! You can now Administrate Persistent Chat in the Lync Server Control Panel and the configuration settings for the Persistent Chat Server are now integrated into the Topology Builder and users can access it from their regular Lync client!
<h2>New Exchange 2013 Integration</h2>
Wish you had one place for both your Lync and Outlook contacts? The unified contact store allows you to store your Lync 2013 contact list in Exchange 2013. You can manage the contact store from Lync 2013, Outlook 2013 and the Outlook Web App. This means you now have a single consolidated store for your email, IM, conferencing, etc.
<h2>The Lync 2013 Client</h2>
This is probably the biggest selling point as far as your user base. The new 2013 Lync Client is full of great new features and improvements. The interface itself is much more modern looking and clean. Persistent Chat rooms are now included in the client making it easier to keep ongoing discussions with your coworkers. The new display options are also great! You can view all of your contacts by Groups, Status or Relationships. Did I mention Tabbed Conversations? You now have the ability to keep all of you calls, IM conversations and chats in one conversation Window. The Tabbed Conversations feature is definitely a game changer in my opinion.
<h2>The Lync 2013 Client: A Cleaner Look</h2>

<h2>The Lync 2013 Client: Tabbed Conversations</h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13703" title="Why Upgrade Microsoft Lync 2013 Photo 2" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/why-upgrade-microsoft-lync-2013-photo-2.png" alt="Why Upgrade Microsoft Lync 2013 Photo 2" width="400" height="317" />
<h2>Topology Changes</h2>
Microsoft has consolidated the Lync Monitoring and Archiving roles into the Front End Server as built in options. The Director role is no longer recommended but optional. Microsoft says, “You can safely exclude the Director with confidence that the Front End Servers will provide the same services in their place.” Additionally, the Front End Pool Architecture has changed. The Back End Database is no longer the real-time store in a pool. User information is now kept on three Front End Servers in the pool. One server is a mast copy and the other two servers are replicas. If a Front End Server that is a mast goes down, one of the other replicas is automatically promoted. This distribution of data storage eliminates the single point of failure of a single backend server.
<h2>Pool Pairing</h2>
In the Lync 2010 server, the HA scheme was server redundancy via Front End pools. The Lync Server 2013 introduces a new HA scheme by enabling “pool pairing” in which you pair pools together in the same or different geographical location. If one of the Front End pools goes down, you can fail over users to the other pool.

The bottom line is that Microsoft has taken a good product and made it a must have product. The improvements made in Lync 2013 make it much more resilient, with a better user experience that’s easier to manage.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[R is a popular (and free) statistical language for predicative analytics and advanced statistical analysis that integrates into the <a title="Business Intelligence Tableau" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/tableau">Tableau</a> business intelligence platform. On <strong>September 4th</strong>, I will be leading a free webinar that will give you an introduction to R and Tableau integration. I encourage you to join me for the live demonstration where I will also answer questions from the audience.

R is an open source software environment and programming language that people use for advanced statistical analysis and predictive analytics. R can be used to do advanced “what if” analysis data mining, linear regressions and sentiment analysis. The tool can also be used to efficiently and effectively complete predictive analysis on big data sets. At SWC, we like R because it’s free and can be integrated into Tableau, one of our favorite business intelligence tools. In the past we have had a <a title="Chicago BI Meetup" href="http://www.meetup.com/Business-Intelligence-Chicagoland/" target="_blank">BI Meetup</a> on R and Tableau integration and have also blogged a little bit about it through our “Ask SWC” video series (See Ask SWC: <a title="New R Feature Tableau" href="/blog/ask-swc/what-is-the-new-r-feature-for-tableau-8-1">What is the New R Feature for Tableau</a>).

If you are interested in learning more about R and Tableau integration and seeing this cool tool in action, I encourage you to register for my upcoming webinar on Thursday, September 4th at the link below: <a href="http://bit.ly/R-and-Tableau-Webinar" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/R-and-Tableau-Webinar</a>

If you are unable to attend the webinar, you can still join us for any of our upcoming <a title="Chicago Business Intelligence Events" href="/events">Chicagoland business intelligence events</a> to learn more about Tableau and all of the new and exciting business intelligence features the Tableau 8.2 release brings.

		<title>SWC Best Practices: Closing the Midmarket IT Talent Gap</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/managed-services/best-practices-closing-midmarket-it-talent-gap</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think one of the challenges a lot of midmarket companies face is that we are in an extremely competitive market for IT talent. According to a <a href="http://media.dice.com/report/january-2014-recruiting-technology-talent-in-the-midwest-gets-tough/" target="_blank">Dice 2014 hiring survey</a>, Chicago is the sixth toughest place in the U.S. to recruit tech talent. Watch my best practices video to learn more about how SWC is helping midmarket organizations close the IT talent gap through <a title="Chicago Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services">managed services</a>.

<a title="Managed IT Services - Closing The Mid-Market IT Talent Gap" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2-ePCnTsVdU?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/susie-cummings-managed-it-services-video-player.png" alt="Managed IT Services Video" width="400" height="281" /></a>

A lot of midmarket companies are struggling to find IT talent and the reality is:
<ul>
	<li>40% of firms planning to hire or have had openings for six months or more because they cannot find the ideal candidate – McKinsey &amp; Company</li>
	<li>64% of companies have positions for which they often cannot find qualified applicants – McKinsey &amp; Company</li>
	<li>Two thirds of IT employees say they are “confident that they can find a new, better” job sometime this year – Dice Salary Survey</li>
	<li>Equal to compensation the largest motivator provided to IT talent during 2014 was “more interesting or challenging assignments” – Dice Salary Survey</li>
	<li>The average U.S. tech salary for 2013 was $87,811 – Dice Salary Survey</li>
	<li>The average U.S. tech salary has increased consistently for 10 years in a row – Dice Salary Survey</li>
</ul>
Frankly, it’s not as compelling for IT talent to work in an internal IT department where they might get exposure to an infrastructure upgrade or really cool project every three years. They end up getting very siloed in terms of their responsibilities. Since we are a <a title="Technology Consulting Company" href="http://www.swc.com">technology consulting company</a>, SWC has a great track record for attracting and retaining IT talent around many core technologies and we are leverage that team, or mass on behalf our clients. We offer our consultants a constant flow of exciting and challenging projects to help broaden their skills. So when a client ends up needing a level three Exchange resource for a one-off project, we have that resource available. The truth is most organizations can only afford a certain number of IT staff members and every day there is a new development in technology. Most midmarket organizations don’t need a full-time Exchange resource, but when you need them, you need them and SWC can provide ready access to that person.

Our clients truly value and appreciate the relationship they have with the technical resources at SWC. Many of our consultants serve as an advisor to our clients, helping them decide which technologies are going to be the best for their organization and have the greatest impact. It’s much easier for our client’s internal IT teams to turn to their SWC resource for help, instead of going out and meeting with ten different vendors trying to find the right solution. Our consultants are great problem solvers and work with hundreds of midmarket organizations each day, in many cases developing their IT strategy and then <a title="IT Environment Management" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">monitoring and managing their IT environments</a>. They see a lot and that helps us develop best practice procedures and metrics as well as an understanding of what technologies work best in what situations. Our consultants can usually say, “Here is the problem that you are trying to solve and here’s how SWC has helped solve it for many other customers just like you with the following technology recommendation.” There is a lot of peace of mind, efficiency and cost savings associated with that model.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just like computers, mobile devices are susceptible to certain <a title="IT Security Services" href="/solutions/security-services">security</a> risks. Watch my best practices video to learn more about today’s security threats and what your organization can do to keep your data safe.

<a title="IT Security Best Practices - What Are Some Mobile Security Risks?" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/G44wgLOLXTk?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/tommy-montgomery-swc-it-security-services-video-player.png" alt="IT Security Services Video" width="400" height="281" /></a>

More than 55% of the Internet is consumed on a mobile device these days. Whether it’s a smartphone or a tablet, mobile devices are susceptible to certain security risks. Some of the same cyber threats and security risks we see on computers are now popping up on mobile devices, such as CryptoLocker. A few days ago there was a release about an Android CryptoLocker version – so it’s not just for PCs. Imagine how devastating it would be if all of the content on your phone or tablet was CryptoLocked and its not just work files that are being locked, its family photos, personal data – everything!

Every device is susceptible to a certain level of security risk, so you really have to be careful and protect against everything. One of the things we don’t see a lot of organizations implementing is mobile protection on their devices. They think it’s just a consumer device. But it’s really another PC, it just happens to be small and mobile. We find Android phones are a little more susceptible to security risks than iPhones because the openness of its open platform. But we’ve seen the same problems with iPhones as we have with Android devices a few weeks ago. In Australia, hackers were locking phones as well phishing for credentials and then using them to locate the servers of the iPhone to lock the devices. If you were hit, you would have to contact Apple to get the phone unlocked, which is very difficult to do.

Organizations need to keep security top of mind and protect all of the devices in their networks. Although mobile security isn’t really on the forefront right now. We have seen some botnets being developed for it. By the nature of mobile, you don’t have fast networks that devices are connected to all of the time. But as these networks become faster, I think we will see some more security risks. To be safe organizations should begin implementing mobile protection as part of their formal security program.

<h2>Chicago Area IT Security Services 630-572-0240</h2>

There is a lot of fear and uncertainty when it comes to today’s cyber security threats. Organizations need to be proactive by enacting a solid security program that includes the right tactics and tools to keep their data safe. SWC can help keep your organization secure by building a solid security foundation. Please join us for our next complimentary <a title="Chicago IT Security Event" href="/events">Security 2.0: Don’t be the Next Target</a> event to learn more about protecting your organization from today’s security threats.<h3>Recommended Security Posts</h3>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[August has been a big month for <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> updates as we’ve seen Microsoft make some interesting patches available for the server, clients, phone edition and mobility. We strongly suggest you keep your Microsoft Lync environment up-to-date with all of these patches for the best possible Lync experience. Read my blog to learn more.
<h2>Lync Server 2013 CU5</h2>
The Microsoft Lync Server 2013 CU5 was just released. The new version includes several bug fixes, some of which have been anticipated for quite some time and others that have been asked for by our clients repeatedly. One of these fixes includes mobile numbers not showing up in the Lync mobile client.

The update can be found here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36820&amp;751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36820&amp;751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6</a>

<h2>Lync Client</h2>
There are quite a few bug fixes for the Microsoft Lync Client in this month’s updates. The download can be found here: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2881070" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2881070</a> or updated via Microsoft update. In our deployments we’ve come across randomly updated and not-updated versions of this component in the Microsoft Office suite. We strongly urge you to keep these products up-to-date as there are often exciting enhancements, specifically for Microsoft Lync since the initial release. If you do not have a clear strategy for keeping clients patched, SWC can help through our <a title="Microsoft Lync Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/microsoft-lync-managed-services">Microsoft Lync Managed Services</a> Offering.
<h2>Lync Phone Edition</h2>
On August 20th an update for the Microsoft Lync Phone Edition was released that made some serious changes. One big change was allowing non-EV users to login and use the phone as an audio endpoint. The other was a change to phone locking. From the update the issue is described as:

“You lock a Microsoft Lync Phone Edition telephone by engaging the "lock" button on the telephone or by locking the computer that is connected to the telephone. The Lync Phone Edition telephone is deployed for Enterprise Voice users. In this situation, you can still make calls by using the telephone.”

The Lync Phone edition update that specifically addresses this issue and can be described here: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2988196" target="_blank">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2988196</a>

A link to the common Polycom edition updates, specifically the Polycom CX500, Polycom CX600 and Polycom CX3000 can be found here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23866" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23866</a>
<h2>Lync Mobile Client</h2>
Forgive me, for I am an iPhone and iPad user and Microsoft just released a new mobility update for these platforms that I am very excited about. The Lync mobile client update allows more conference control. It’s now easier than ever to admit users in the lobby or promote and demote presenters from your mobile device.

Now the iPad client also has a gallery view! You can see up to four live video streams when connected to a conference.

For more information on the Lync Mobile Client update, please visit: <a href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/08/26/lync-mobile-update-gallery-view-ipad-participant-management-ipad-iphone" target="_blank">http://blogs.office.com/2014/08/26/lync-mobile-update-gallery-view-ipad-participant-management-ipad-iphone</a>

August has certainly been an exciting month for Microsoft Lync updates. If you need help planning your updates or migration to Microsoft Lync 2013, please contact SWC or join us for our next <a title="Chicago Microsoft Lync Event" href="/events">Microsoft Unified Communications event</a>.

		<title>Tell Us What You Think: Net Neutrality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Net neutrality is a big topic that will affect many organizations. <a title="IT Solutions Provider" href="http://www.swc.com">IT solutions provider</a>, SWC, wants to know what midmarket professionals think. Watch our recent video blog to learn more. Net neutrality… where do you stand?

<a title="Tell Us What You Think: Net Neutrality - What's Your View?" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DUNsHfuZHrc?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-technology-partners-tell-us-what-you-think-series.png" alt="SWC Technology Partners - Net Neutrality" width="500" height="281" /></a>

Net neutrality is the principle that all content running through the Internet’s pipes should be treated equally. On April 23rd the FCC announced new proposed rules that would give Internet service providers the "right to build special lanes" that allow content providers to pay for a guaranteed fast lane of service. On May 15th the FCC decided to consider two options regarding Internet services:
<ol>
	<li>Permit fast and slow broadband lanes, compromising net neutrality</li>
	<li>Reclassify broadband as a telecommunication service, preserving net neutrality</li>
</ol>
Today the FCC is seeking public comment on how best to protect and promote an open Internet. It is a big topic and SWC wants to know what midmarket professionals think.

<em>“I think net neutrality is a very core issue and open Internet is pretty critical, it levels the playing field for new companies to come in and compete against large competitors, drives innovation and opens up information for people. To limit the limit the Internet or at least direct and optimum access of consumers to all of the Internet would allow people to buy preferential treatment which would completely eliminate that open field playing model that has made the Internet so great.”</em> – Matt, Director of IT

<em>“I think net neutrality is extremely worrying and has some very worrying implications and very chilling effects on freedom of speech and the freedom of expression online. I am all in favor of ISPs being treated as common carriers. I do not believe that traffic should be allowed to be prioritized in the fashion that a lot of people think is going to happen.”</em> – Shane, IT Manager

<em>“A problem that I see in our country is that the little people don’t have a voice and the Internet has always provided that voice no matter what form you wanted to have it, freedom of speech is very important and the fact that you have the ability to use that tool freely. I belong to a lot of different groups where their message has to get out from a not-for-profit standpoint and not-for-profits don’t have this ability to spend a lot of money on maximizing their message to the world because that is not the basis for a not-for-profit, they are using that money for whatever organizational goals that they have. So to say that they cannot necessarily be as competitive online impacts them tremendously.”</em> – Julie, Computer Operations Manager

<em>“I think net neutrality is very important and I think we need to maintain it. Don’t allow money to equal free speech.”</em> – Bo, Senior Support Specialist

<em>“Protecting net neutrality should be one of the FCC’s utmost priorities, they have to ignore the influx of cash from lobbyist and the big ISPs that are pushing for a premium Internet and listen to the rampant outcry of technologists and consumers alike who are clamoring for a neutral Internet.”</em> – Matt, Director of IT

<em>“I think people should really take it upon themselves to be informed about net neutrality. It’s a huge issue and it affects a lot more people than people seem to think it does. Take five, ten or 15 minutes and Google it, net neutrality and see what people are saying about it. There’s a wealth of information about it available now. Do a little homework, try to read articles from varied sources and get both sides of the story. I think it is very important for anyone who uses the Internet regularly, which let’s be honest is everyone, or almost everyone. Those numbers are not going down, it’s a very important issue for people to know about."</em> – Shane, IT Manager

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your <a title="Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/configuration-manager-sccm">Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager 2012 R2</a> environment is all set up, running and you are using it to deploy software in your environment. It is all working great until one day… it does not! The software deployment fails on one of your VIP's machines, or as I recently encountered, a package failed to install for no reason during a pilot deployment. SCCM is an amazing tool, but it also has a lot of moving parts. What do you do when the unexpected happens or when a task you need to accomplish does not work? Read my blog on SCCM troubleshooting 101 to learn more.

Here is what I do in those situations when I need to troubleshoot an error or an issue in SCCM. The specifics often depend on what component I am troubleshooting, but the general process is still the same:
<ol>
	<li>Note any error codes in the console</li>
	<li>Determine the log files to investigate</li>
	<li>Open the log(s) in CMTrace</li>
	<li>Study the log conversation</li>
	<li>Lookup error codes</li>
	<li>Solve the problem!</li>
</ol>
We will cover the steps in more detail in subsequent blogs, but let's start with what the console provides for troubleshooting. In SCCM 2012 R2, the console has a great Monitoring workspace.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13867" title="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 1 Monitoring" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-1-monitoring.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 Monitoring" width="500" height="245" />

You can get information from the SCCM 2012 R2 Monitoring workspace, such as the status of content on distribution points or overall system status from the Monitoring workspace. For troubleshooting failures in software distribution, the deployments node is where to go for insight.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13868" title="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 2 Deployments Node" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-2-deployments-node.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 Deployments Node" width="500" height="254" />

In the deployments node, you can see all deployments, both active and ones completed in the past. A quick glance will show completion statistics for the various deployments. If you need more information, you can double click a deployment and specific information for each system and status will be shown.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13869" title="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 3 Deployment Status" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-3-deployment-status.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 3 Deployment Status" width="500" height="250" />

The SCCM R2 deployment status will also show messages and some details about the success or failure of the deployment.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13870" title="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 4 Success" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-4-success.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 4 Success" width="500" height="245" />

If your deployment shows an error, the description is a good place to start troubleshooting. You can search online for the error message; however, as you can see in the screenshot above, sometimes the description is less than helpful. When you need more details, SCCM's extensive log files provide in depth information. The logs can be overwhelming, so we will cover how to use them in another post. For now, happy troubleshooting! And remember, SWC's System Center team has extensive experience with SCCM and is ready to help with all of your troubleshooting needs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the advantages that SWC brings to the table when it comes to <a title="Chicago Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services">managed services</a> is the fact that we have specialized consultants and resources around the architecture and implementation of today’s most prevalent technology solutions, such as Microsoft Exchange, Lync, SharePoint and CRM. Watch my best practices video to learn more about why partnering with an <a title="Managed IT Service Provider" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">IT managed services provider</a> is a best practice for many midmarket organizations.

<a title="Managed Services Best Practices: Enhanced Managed IT Services" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ryfK14zn-3c?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/susie-cummings-managed-it-services-video-player.png" alt="Managed IT Services Video" width="400" height="281" /></a>

SWC offers <a title="Specialized Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/specialized-managed-services">enhanced managed services</a> around the architecture and implementation of today’s most prevalent technology solutions, including Microsoft Exchange, Lync, SharePoint and CRM. SWC helps our clients by providing proactive support for these technologies post implementation on a 24/7 basis. Our enhanced managed services offering can augment an organization’s internal IT team, as many midmarket companies don’t need or simply can’t afford to staff a full-time resource for Microsoft Exchange, Lync, SharePoint or CRM. Most organizations chose to hire SWC for these enhanced managed services at the end of their Microsoft Exchange, Lync, SharePoint or CRM project deployments. In the event that there is an issue, we already know what has transpired through our monitoring, alerting and reporting services and have ready access to a resource who can get service up and running at the level our clients expect with a guaranteed SLA.

There are many benefits to partnering with SWC for enhanced managed IT services, including:
<ul>
	<li>A comprehensive service offering delivered through our Software, Infrastructure and Managed Services practices. Our engineers have deep and broad experience in many of the technologies most midmarket organizations use today.</li>
	<li>Access to a team of more 150 experienced Chicagoland consultants to monitor, track and repair any IT challenge – on a 24x7 basis</li>
	<li>A long-term partnership model focused on cost effectively developing infrastructure strategies and roadmaps to drive business impact and support business goals</li>
	<li>Solutions that are adaptive and flexible to meet the changing needs of your organization in a predictable month-to-month cost structure</li>
</ul>

		<title>Microsoft Azure Machine Learning – A Data Tool for the Masses</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/business-intelligence/microsoft-azure-machine-learning</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was a freshmen at North Dakota State University in the fall of 1991, I worked as advertising manager at the college newspaper. It was a simple job, motivate the sales reps to sell as many ads as possible so that the editors can publish a big newspaper. Sounds simple doesn’t it? Of course, the size of the newspaper was always decided a few hours before we went to press and being able to predict the size was a difficult task since the only tools we had were Lotus 1-2-3. This decision was always made last minute with all of the data we had available. Times and technology were ripe for disruptive change in 1991!
<h2>Fast forward to 2014.</h2>
A lot has changed in my life since 1991. But what hasn’t changed is my desire to use information to make good decisions. The only difference is that we have compelling tools and technology to make decisions faster, more accurately and quite possibly much sooner than was ever possible. For years, industries like finance, insurance and retail have had access to these prediction tools and the IT infrastructure to operate them. A very expensive proposition in the past. Today, that game has changed. There are many lower cost options a business or individual can use to do the things the big boys have been doing for years. We’ve watched the rise of predicative open source tools like “R” and self-service tools like PowerPivot, <a title="Business Intelligence Tableau" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/tableau">Tableau</a> and Qlik become pervasive in many small and midmarket organizations. The promise of faster adhoc analysis and the ability to predict with easy to use tools are here now.
<h2>Enter Azure Machine Learning.</h2>
In July of this year, Microsoft made a major announcement in the predicative analytics space. The pre-release/beta announcement of Microsoft Azure Machine Learning was upon us. I’ve been dabbling in open source “R” for the past year and many times have become frustrated with my lack of skill in the details of predictive modeling using a command line interface. That confidence and frustration was completely eliminated once I started building models with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning.

<h3>Business Intelligence Solutions 630.572.0240</h3>

<h2>Operational Predictive Analytics Made Easy.</h2>
Microsoft Azure Machine Learning makes it easy to build experiments with a learning curve less steep than pure “R.” The tool’s success is going to come from making predictive models operational in a much shorter amount of time and at a lower cost. Can you say ROI? Microsoft has been committed to predictive analytics for many releases of <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL Server</a> and while the tools work, making the results and usage of those models operational was a substantial customized undertaking. Microsoft Azure Machine Learning changes this by automating the deployment of proven experiment models to web services that can seamlessly be integrated with web applications and visualization tools.
<h2>How Can I Learn More?</h2>
On September 25th the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Business-Intelligence-Chicagoland/events/203302332/" target="_blank">Business Intelligence Chicagoland meetup group</a> will be discussing and reviewing our work with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. We’ll start with a demonstration of how to build a model and integrate with a website and then we’ll transition to a customer retention case study we’ve been working on and look at how the service can be utilized to solve real world business problems. I hope you can join us!

		<title>Five Questions to Ask Before Investing in a Cloud Service</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the ever growing world of cloud services, it can be very difficult to figure out which <a title="SWC Cloud Services" href="/solutions/cloud-services">cloud vendor</a> is right for your organization. While some vendors might try to tell you otherwise, there are a number of different factors that need to be considered before investing in a cloud service. Read my blog on the top five questions you should ask before picking a cloud service to learn more.

At SWC, we have vast technical experience installing and managing a range of servers and applications and have the knowledge to help you determine which cloud service is best for your organization. The first step is to understand your requirements and then design the right approach. We work with a variety of today’s market leading cloud vendors who possess many different features and focus areas and can help you understand the cloud marketplace and find the right vendor or vendors for your organization.

<h3>SWC Cloud Solutions 630.572.0240</h3>

Here are five of the most common questions you should consider before investing in a cloud service:
<ol>
	<li><strong>What do you need the cloud service to do?</strong> Many organizations are feeling the pressure to go into the cloud, even if they aren’t sure what the benefit might be. The cloud is a wonderful tool, but it is still a tool and it is important to think in terms of how the cloud can improve your organization instead of how your organization can get into the cloud quickly. If you are unsure how to get started, SWC can work with you to <a title="Cloud Network Readiness Assessment" href="/solutions/cloud-services/network-readiness-assessment">evaluate your environment</a> and architect a clear, pragmatic and successful path to the cloud, making sure you get the best cloud experience possible.</li>
	<li><strong>What is the full cost of the service?</strong> One of the major benefits of many cloud services is that you only pay for what you use, but this flexibility can also lead to several unexpected charges. For example, two of the most popular cloud services – Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services charge not just for the compute and storage space being used but also for the amount of data transferred across the Internet and the amount of storage transactions (I/O) being performed. The cloud could be very costly for your organization if you don’t know which features are included and which features you have to pay for.</li>
	<li><strong>What level of support and SLAs are offered?</strong> Each cloud service offers different support and SLA options and with many vendors you have to pay extra for full support. One of the best benefits of a cloud service is that someone else has to worry about your hardware and uptime, so make sure that when there is a problem you have someone ready and waiting to resolve the outage and get you back online quickly.</li>
	<li><strong>How easy is it to get your data into and out of the cloud?</strong> When setting up a cloud service, you may have a lot of data that needs to be imported to get you up and running. Many cloud services have tools where you can send them hard drives or do batch imports of data through special tools. Before picking a vendor, see if they have a tool that will fit your needs so that you don’t have to manually recreate all of your data to get it into the cloud.</li>
</ol>
Alternatively, cloud services are constantly changing and at some point you may find that there is a better service available or that you need to bring your data back onsite. In that situation, does the cloud vendor have a good method for getting your data back to you in a usable manner? Some vendors try to lock you into their service by making data exports difficult. Make sure to investigate what steps are required to get data out of the system before choosing a cloud vendor.

Do you need to consider any legal compliance considerations? Security in the cloud is a very common question and a topic we will address in subsequent blog posts. Many cloud services are certified compliant against common security standards (ISO, SOC, PCI, etc.), but if your organization requires these certifications it is important to verify that with the cloud vendor.

As you can see there are many different aspects to consider when moving to the cloud and SWC can help you find a cloud solution that is right for your business. To learn more, please call 630-572-0240.<h3>Recommended Cloud Posts</h3>

		<title>SWC Best Practices: From a Security Perspective, What is the Worst Case Scenario?</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/security/it-security-worst-case-scenario</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every day we are seeing a rise in the number of <a title="IT Security Services" href="/solutions/security-services">security</a> events with an estimated 117,339 daily attacks, it’s scary to think that your organization or the organizations you conduct business with might be vulnerable. However, this number is a low estimate as most organizations are unaware that they have been attacked or fail to report an security breach. Watch my best practices video to learn more about today’s security threats, the worst case scenarios and what your organization can do to keep your data safe.

<a title="IT Security Best Practices - What's The Worst Case Scenario?" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eObMgv7E-5g?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/tommy-montgomery-swc-it-security-services-video-player.png" alt="IT Security Services Video" width="400" height="281" /></a>

In terms of worst case scenarios, we have seen a lot lately. Security is a serious matter and a lot of large corporations such as Target, Jewel-Osco, Home Depot and now JPMorgan have been the targets of security breaches and data hacks. In my opinion, there are two worst case scenarios when it comes to security. One is the Target situation, where their entire database of credit card numbers was leaked online. These credit card numbers weren’t encrypted, they were decrypted – or captured before encryption. That’s about as bad as it gets. The CEO lost his job, the CIO lost his job and a lot of shareholder’s lost value in the company. Once there’s a loss of confidence in the business, it’s hard to gain that back and Target is still fully feeling the effects of that.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14008" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/it-security-target-breach-credit-card-numbers.jpg" alt="IT Security Target Breach Credit Card Numbers" width="500" height="390" />

The second worst case security scenario is <a title="CryptoLocker Virus Tips – Take Action Now" href="/blog/managed-services/cryptolocker-virus-tips-take-action-now">CryptoLocker</a>. CryptoLocker is ransomware that infects an organization via an email attachment. We’ve had a lot of customers that are concerned about CryptoLocker and we’ve also seen a lot in the news about companies getting hit with CryptoLocker. CryptoLocker is one of the worst case scenarios in my opinion, because it infects a user’s computer and then searches for file shares that the users has access. The malware then CryptoLocks or encrypts all of the organization’s files the user has access to. That could potentially be devastating for a corporation.

Typically the hackers then hold the file shares hostage and say that once you pay a certain amount they will provide you with the key to un-encrypt them. We advise our clients not to pay this ransom, the hackers will just keep furthering the situation if you pay. The key to preventing CryptoLocker and related security breaches is to have good backups and also prevention in place. SWC can work with you on this and provide you with that prevention. These security breaches do not have to happen and they do not have to be caught after the fact. They can be prevented beforehand. Don’t be the next target, <a title="Contact SWC" href="mailto:info@swc.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20security%20and%20preventing%20Shellshock">contact us</a> today for an information security assessment to see where your organization’s vulnerabilities lie and how we can help you build a solid security foundation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With winter right around the corner, Tandem HR turned to SWC to deploy a telephony solution that would help make their employees more mobile and productive outside the office. We deployed Microsoft Lync, which enabled their team to work remotely and still answer client calls 24/7 – even during the worst Chicago snowstorm! Watch our client success video case study to learn more about how Tandem HR is finding success using Microsoft Lync and SWC <a title="Microsoft Lync Managed Services" href="/solutions/managed-services/microsoft-lync-managed-services">Microsoft Lync Managed Services</a>.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mL-0IOlmo9g?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0" rel="shadowbox;width=720;height=480;"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-lync-tandem-hr.jpg" alt="Microsoft Lync Managed Services Solution Tandem HR" width="500" height="281" /></a>

Tandem HR is a human resource outsourcing company and professional employment organization. Tandem HR provides their clients solutions in the areas of benefits, employee assistance programs, human resources, payroll, risk and more. Before Tandem HR engaged SWC to deploy <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a>, the organization had been using a phone system with handset phones that required them to be in their office to check voicemails and answer client calls. Microsoft Lync has helped make Tandem HR mobile and more productive outside of the office. This was especially true last winter.

Since Tandem HR is based outside of Chicago, they experienced some terrible winter snowstorms last year. With their old phone system, employees had to be in the office to answer client clients, as the organization couldn’t give snow days when their clients were on the line. Microsoft Lync is an enterprise ready telephony solution that gives users the ability to make voice calls from their computers, mobile devices or using a Microsoft Lync enabled desk phone. When last year’s snow storms were heading in and Chicago was getting inches of snow and below freezing temperatures, Tandem HR employees were able to work from home and remotely answer their client calls using Microsoft Lync on their laptops, enabling the business to continue running 24/7.
When we deploy Microsoft Lync, we don’t walk away and except the customer to maintain it. It’s a partnership. Tandem HR signed up for SWC’s Microsoft Lync Managed Services offering giving them 24x7 monitoring and support. Tandem HR knew there was going to be a huge snowstorm and that they were going to close the office, which would present some call center challenges. The organization was able to lean on SWC, right in the middle of the night. A call came into the SWC Managed Services team and it was escalated to our Microsoft Lync team who was able to go in and remotely help them with everything they needed. The next day everything operated seamlessly and business ran as usual.

		<title>SCCM Troubleshooting 101: Log Files</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-system-center/sccm-troubleshooting-101-log-files</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As my last blog mentioned, one tool in the <a title="System Center Configuration Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/configuration-manager-sccm">Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager</a> (SCCM) troubleshooting toolbox is the monitoring workspace console. The monitoring workspace console provides a wealth of information and is a great place to start looking when you receive an error message. But sometimes the console’s description may not provide enough information to help you troubleshoot the issue you may be having. That’s where the SCCM log files can help. Check out my recent blog on SCCM Troubleshooting 101: Log Files to learn more.

SCCM has extensive log files to help provide in depth information when you receive and error message. The location of the log files depends on the SCCM component generating the log, the specific configuration of site systems and clients in your environment. For clients, the logs are generally located in C:\Windows\CCM\Logs (This will be different for older versions of SCCM).

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14041" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-log-files-a.jpg" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 Log Files" width="500" height="238" />

Once you know what log you need to examine, you can open the log file and start reviewing it. For example, if you are troubleshooting package and program deployment, you need to look at the execmgr.log on a client machine. By default, if you double click to open the log file, it will open in Notepad as a text file.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14042" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-log-files-b.jpg" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 Log Files" width="500" height="326" />

Opening the log file in Notepad will certainly allow you to get information, but there is another tool in the SCCM troubleshooting toolbox that will revolutionize log file review – CMTrace.
CMTrace is a log file viewer that is now included with SCCM 2012 R2. It can be found on the SCCM site server in the installation location. In my lab, it is found here:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14043" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-log-files-c.jpg" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 Log Files" width="500" height="158" />

When you launch CMTrace for the first time, you will be prompted to make it the default viewer for log files. I always accept by saying “Yes.”

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14044" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-log-files-d.jpg" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 Log Files" width="500" height="345" />

Now you can use CMTrace to view the execmgr.log. Potential errors and warnings are highlighted as shown and automatic scrolling is enabled so that the log can be viewed in real-time.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14045" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-log-files-e.jpg" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 Log Files" width="500" height="307" />

If you need to examine multiple log files, you can use CMTrace to merge the files together. You click open, select the log file, and check the box for “Merge selected files.”

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14046" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-log-files-f.jpg" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 Log Files" width="500" height="307" />

CMTrace opens all of the selected logs and merges them together for a complete view.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14047" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-log-files-g.jpg" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 Log Files" width="500" height="305" />

Finally, CMTrace provides an error lookup tool. If an error code is referenced in the log file you are viewing, you can enter the error code into the tool and get a brief description of what the code means.

To use the error lookup, go to Tools | Error Lookup.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14048" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-log-files-h.jpg" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 Log Files" width="371" height="284" />

Enter your error code and click Lookup.

So far we have seen what the SCCM console provides for troubleshooting (check out Jeff’s past blog post – <a title="SCCM Troubleshooting 101" href="/blog/microsoft-system-center/sccm-troubleshooting-101-overview">SCCM Troubleshooting 101: AN Overview</a>) and looked at SCCM logging. CMTrace is a powerful tool for helping as we examine the many log files SCCM generates. Next time, we will look at a specific troubleshooting scenario and put all of our new knowledge to good use. If you are still having trouble troubleshooting your SCCM environment, SWC’s <a title="Microsoft System Center Services" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center">System Center team</a> has extensive experience with SCCM and is ready to help you with all of your troubleshooting needs.

		<title>SWC Best Practices: Security Managed Services</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today a lot of our conversations with midmarket C-level executives are focused around the uncertainty of what’s really happening from an <a title="IT Security Services" href="/solutions/security-services">IT security</a> perspective. We have a number of prospects and customers that are constantly getting hit with viruses and security threats and they don’t know why. Watch my best practices video to learn more about why partnering with an <a title="Managed IT Service Provider" href="/solutions/managed-services/managed-it-solutions">IT managed services provider</a> for security services is a best practice for many midmarket organizations.

<a title="Managed IT Services Best Practices: Security Managed Services" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gH1zjZwLk4k?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/susie-cummings-managed-it-services-video-player.png" alt="Managed IT Services Video" width="400" height="281" /></a>

I think there are a lot of C-level executives facing challenges around security and understanding what responsibilities they have. We have worked with a lot of clients who are middle market organizations serving enterprise customers that need to comply with their security requirements and ensure that the data they are sending is secure. Thus we have a lot of security work and as an extension of that we deliver <a title="Security Managed Services" href="/solutions/security-services/security-managed-services">security managed services</a> as a best practice.

The first step is to help our clients build a solid security foundation to protect their organization with next generation security solutions for today’s cyber threats. This includes market leading security tools for firewalls, malware detection and Network Access Controls to prevent attacks such as botnets and CryptoLocker. Once a security program has been put in place, our managed services security team begins completing daily security checks and quarterly security scans to make sure our customer are staying safe and compliant.

One of the things that has also been scary for a lot of organization is Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and the lack of control IT has any more on the many devices that are engaging an organization’s environment and network. One of the areas SWC’s managed services security practice has done a lot of work on is determining what strategies need to be employed around BYOD and what kind of controls can be employed from a technology perspective to not only protect the organization’s data but also protect their client’s data as well and ensure compliance.

There are many benefits to partnering with SWC for security managed IT services. SWC’s approach provides our clients with not only a highly responsive team of subject matter experts, but also comprehensive coverage and predictable costs. Our security managed services offering includes:
<ul>
	<li>Vulnerability scanning</li>
	<li>Monitoring and management of firewalls</li>
	<li>Security log review</li>
	<li>Threat intelligence bulletins</li>
	<li>IPS / IDS tuning and management</li>
	<li>Next generation firewall and web application solutions</li>
	<li>Strategic IT roadmap and virtual CIO consulting services</li>

		<title>Predictive Analytics Made Easy with Microsoft Azure Machine Learning</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/ask-swc/predictive-analytics-microsoft-azure-machine-learning</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Microsoft Azure Machine Learning" href="/blog/business-intelligence/microsoft-azure-machine-learning">Microsoft Azure Machine Learning</a> is a new and powerful cloud based predictive analytics tool that gives users the ability to quickly forecast future trends and behaviors. Watch my “Ask SWC” video to see how easy it is to create predictive analytics models using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning.

<a title="New Features of Tableau 8.2" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ody8vnzQ-AU?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Azure Machine Learning" width="474" height="262" /></a>

In my Microsoft Azure Machine Learning video, we built an experiment to predict possible buyers with a data set used to analyze prospective buyers and determine whether they were likely to buy our product or not. We also discuss how we were able to take the outcome of this experiment and make it into something that we could integrate with other applications to optimize the predictive analytics experiment. Through the sample we created I am able to go to my scoring model, set a publishing input and set a publishing output. The setting of the input and output will give Azure the information it needs to publish a web service.

<h3>Microsoft Azure and BI Solutions 630.570.0240</h3>

The publishing capability is one of the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning’s best features. There were predictive analytics and modeling capabilities in <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL</a> a few versions ago that were fairly hard and time-consuming to use. Now that Microsoft has moved predictive analytics to the cloud with Azure, publishing is easy.

If you are interested in learning more about Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, SWC is sponsoring a <a title="Chicago Business Intelligence" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Chicagoland Business Intelligence</a> Meetup on <strong>October 30th at Microsoft’s office in Downers Grove, Illinois</strong>. At this meetup we will show some practical demos to help you get up to speed with Azure Machine Learning. We will also discuss licensing and storage considerations, review end-to-end machine learning solutions integrated with a web app and review a real case study looking at customer churn. This complimentary event is open to those wanting to learn more and network with BI users in a fun and social setting. We hope you will join us by registering at the link below:

If you can’t make our meetup, SWC also presents complimentary monthly Chicagoland educational events on various technology solutions, including Microsoft Azure and Business Intelligence. Please visit <a title="SWC Events" href="/events">SWC Events</a> to learn more and register.

		<title>Flexible and Scalable Web Hosting with Microsoft Azure</title>
		<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/flexible-scalable-web-hosting-microsoft-azure</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At <a title="IT Solutions Provider" href="http://www.swc.com">IT solutions provider</a>, SWC, we often get asked questions about web hosting. There is an ongoing debate over whether an organization should use a public hosting solution like GoDaddy or Network Solutions or their own servers. Public hosting solutions provide easy hosting and guaranteed uptime, but don’t always offer the full feature set an organization is looking for. Alternatively, some organizations opt to host their website on their own servers making internal IT staff responsible for the site’s maintenance and uptime. Microsoft Azure Websites provides a middle ground, read my blog to learn more.

<h3>SWC Cloud Solutions 630.572.0240</h3>

Microsoft Azure is a <a title="Chicago Cloud Services" href="/solutions/cloud-services">cloud platform</a> that offers fully hosted and customizable websites. The underlying maintenance and management of the system is controlled by Microsoft, so you’re guaranteed 99.9% uptime without your organization’s internal IT staff getting involved. The website can be configured either through a web editor or via file upload and Azure can also integrate with Git, TFS and GitHub for easier continuous deployment of site changes and updates. Azure websites also have all of the common programming languages available including .Net, Java, PHP, Python, etc.

However, unlike some other services, Azure Websites can go a step further because they can integrate with other Azure services. This allows Azure websites to have a database backend such as <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">Microsoft SQL</a>, MySQL, DocumentDB and others using Azure resources. If you already have these databases onsite and want to connect to your existing data sources, Azure makes that possible as well. This flexibility makes it is easy to setup any number of packaged templates – such as WordPress, Joomla or Drupal in a matter of minutes.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14181" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/azure-web-hosting-setup.jpg" alt="Azure Web Hosting Setup" width="500" height="348" />

One other area that sets Azure apart from many of the other hosting vendors is the new, more advanced auto-scaling feature. Many vendors including Azure will monitor your traffic and when a usage spike occurs, retroactively scale your services to try to keep up with the demand. In this scenario, anyone who tries to visit your site before the system can scale properly will have poor performance. But what about scenarios where you know in advance that your site is going to have higher than normal usage – such as when a new promotion or mailing goes out? Azure gives you the flexibility to preschedule your resources to scale up at a specific date and time and then once the usage goes back to normal, you can schedule your Azure website resources to scale back down.

Microsoft Azure Websites may be the solution for greater flexibility in your organization’s cloud hosting. Our goal at SWC is to be a partner to help find the right cloud solution, we work with a number of cloud vendors to ensure the right fit for your organization’s specific needs. Our cloud consultants have an extensive technical background and know what requirements to consider before moving applications and systems to the cloud, including when moving to the cloud is not recommended. We can apply that expertise to your environment. For more information on Microsoft Azure and cloud services <a title="Contact SWC" href="/contact">contact SWC</a> or attend one of our complimentary <a title="Cloud Events Chicago" href="/events">Chicagoland cloud luncheons</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A challenge most organizations face is trying to convince salespeople to log calls in their CRM system. Most salespeople complain that it takes way too long. But isn’t that the point of using a CRM system – being able to understand previous interactions you have had with prospects, leads or even current customers and react based on the results of those actions? Read my blog to learn more about a new tool that SWC has developed to integrate <a title="Microsoft Lync Services" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync </a>with Dynamics CRM for call tracking and how it will make call logging quicker and much easier for your sales team.

Microsoft has significantly improved the user interface and experience in their latest release of <a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM" href="/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Dynamics CRM</a>. They have also reduced the number of clicks required to log calls with a new social pane. SWC has taken these improvements one step further by integrating Microsoft Lync and Microsoft Dynamics CRM for call tracking.

The SWC Lync Call Monitor was developed to allow users with Microsoft Lync 2013 enabled phone systems to monitor inbound call events and provide them with an easy mechanism for logging the call that took place with real-time information about the caller. All the user has to do is click to log it. The photo below shows the Lync Call Monitor, a small application that runs in a users’ background listening for inbound calls:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14275" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-lync-call-monitor.png" alt="Microsoft Lync Call Monitor" width="500" height="96" />

The application automatically looks to match a contact in CRM when a call comes in. The user then has the option to open up the caller’s CRM contact record, or they can create a new CRM phone call activity for the contact. From there, SWC can customize the Lync Call Monitor solution to fit your organization’s unique business process needs.

Make call logging easier for your sales team with Microsoft Lync 2013. Contact us for more information or attend one of our upcoming <a title="Chicago Technology Events" href="/events">Chicagoland technology events</a> to learn more about Microsoft Lync and Dynamics CRM.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By now just about anyone keeping tabs on <a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM" href="/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a> has seen that CRM 2015 is scheduled to be released in Q4 of this year. I have seen some confusion around what the 2015 release brings, which portions of the release are already available and how the feature set differs for online and on-premise customers. I wanted to break it all down for you in my blog on everything you need to know about the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2015 release.
<h2>Fall 2013</h2>
Microsoft released CRM 2013 – this version release provided a complete new user interface which added many brand new compelling features (check out our blog – <a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 Features" href="/blog/ask-swc/cool-new-features-of-microsoft-dynamics-crm-2013">What Are Some Cool New Features of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013</a> to learn more).
<h2>Spring 2014</h2>
Microsoft released some new features and fixed some standing issues in a large rollup called the “Spring 2014 Update” or CRM 2013 Service Pack 1. For on-premise customers, this was installed as a service pack executable on your CRM servers, while for online customers, the update was managed through the “install updates” button in the settings section of CRM.

The most sought after features of this release come in the form of Social Listening and Microsoft Dynamics Marketing Automation. Both of these solutions bring the Microsoft solution that much closer to functional parity with Salesforce, but at a lower price point without utilizing third party solutions like Radian6 and <a title="ExactTarget Business Solutions" href="/solutions/crm/salesforce-com-customer-relationship-management/exacttarget-digital-marketing">ExactTarget</a>.

<strong>Social Listening:</strong>
Social listening allows customers to track various social platforms of their customers and measure things like posting rates, geographic activity and sentiment about your brands, services and competitors. This service was available for online customers only and is included with the base licensing.

<strong>Dynamics Marketing:</strong>
Dynamics Marketing is a cloud based service model that allows for robust visual campaign setup and execution that integrates with your online or on-premise CRM. Emails are sent from Microsoft’s servers instead of your own network and they measure ROI based events like delivery, opens and click-through rates and then push the information back into CRM. They also will provide lead scoring based on responses to marketing activity. This service is available for online and on-premise customers and requires additional licensing of $125 per user per month.

I will dig in further on these two major feature additions over the course of my next two blog posts.
<h2>Q4 2014</h2>
In Q4, Microsoft will release Dynamics CRM 2015. The user interface remains largely unchanged, while many new features are added and many existing features are improved. The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/crm-customer-center/get-ready-for-the-next-release.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2015 Release Preview Guide</a> seems to show the Social and Marketing features as being new, even though they have been in place since the spring update. There are however some additional improvements to this functionality and some great technical improvements such as:
<ul>
	<li>CRM 2013 brought us the visual sales process which allows us to see the sales stage of an opportunity and dynamically change the information captured in that stage. Now in 2015, we will be able to dynamically change the sales process and add branching logic based on the opportunities attributes</li>
	<li>Global search field present in the navigation will allow you to search for terms across all supported entities at once and provide results from in a single screen</li>
	<li>Increased sales order functionality mostly centering around the capability to create product bundles to promote upselling</li>
	<li>The social listening feature will now be available for on-premise customers</li>
	<li>Visual hierarchy feature will allow you to see in a “tree” structure how accounts are related to child accounts. This feature applies to products and users as well.</li>
	<li>Addition of “roll-up” fields and “calculated” fields that allow automatic summations and calculations. The calculations will run in an asynchronous process and will automatically calculate in batch when they are first added to an entity with existing records.</li>
	<li>There will be new security model changes that allow for visibility based on hierarchy in the organization</li>
</ul>

		<title>Performance and Schedule Autoscaling in Microsoft Azure</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you have a website or application that experiences heavy traffic in peaks during certain days, weeks or months of the year? Do your servers sit idle for extended periods of time? Are you paying to support your peak loads in off-peak times? If you answered "Yes" to any of these questions, Azure autoscaling may be something to consider. Read my blog on performance and schedule autoscaling in Azure to learn more.

<h3>SWC Cloud Solutions 630.572.0240</h3>

Azure is Microsoft’s <a title="Chicago Cloud Services" href="/solutions/cloud-services">cloud platform</a> for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). Comprised of a growing collection of integrated services for applications, computing, data, networking and storage, Microsoft Azure has been ranked as an industry leader by Gartner due to its ability to help organizations do more, work faster and save money. Azure’s IaaS offering gives you the flexibility to define your environment requirements based on assumptions, then make adjustments once those assumptions are confirmed – in minutes. For example, if you expect 1,000 concurrent users to hit your site for the entire month of December during the peak shopping season, but later find that you only need to support that high load during the third week of December, Azure can be configured to dynamically adjust the number and size of servers as needed.

There are essentially two types of scaling options in Azure:
<ul>
	<li>Performance-based Autoscaling</li>
	<li>Schedule-based Autoscaling</li>
</ul>
Performance-based autoscaling in Azure monitors the average CPU usage and message queues. Azure can dynamically add Virtual Machine instances when CPU utilization exceeds a threshold set by an administrator, then turn the new <a title="Virtualization Solutions" href="/solutions/virtualization">Virtual Machine</a> off when usage returns to the target threshold. Similarly, the number of messages in a queue can be monitored and Virtual Machines can be turned on or off from what's known as an availability set.

If performance-based scaling is too reactive for your needs and the load on your servers is more predictable, schedule-based autoscaling can be used in a more proactive approach. For example, anticipated load based on events such as a go-live date, running of a TV commercial or a published registration date can be accommodated by configuring Azure to add resources on a targeted date and time. Used in conjunction with performance-based autoscaling, you can specify the number of additional Virtual Machines you think you will need, then let Azure add more if your target utilization thresholds are exceeded.

Azure's benefits can be summarized by speed, scale and economics. The autoscaling features in Azure reflect all three:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Speed</strong> – Setting up new environments can be done in minutes, with no manual intervention</li>
	<li><strong>Scale</strong> – Size your environment appropriately based on intermittent, short-term or long-term needs</li>
	<li><strong>Economics</strong> – Pay only for the resources used and then “turn it off” when they aren't needed</li>
</ul>

		<title>SCCM Troubleshooting 101: An Example</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’ve read my last two blogs, you probably have a good understanding of <a title="Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/configuration-manager-sccm">Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager </a>(SCCM) and the monitoring workspace in the SCCM console, SCCM log files and CMTrace. In this blog, I wanted to walk you through a specific SCCM troubleshooting scenario. Read my SCCM troubleshooting 101 blog to learn more.

In this case, I created a simple package with a single program that I deployed to a collection.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14386" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-1.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 1" width="500" height="129" />

When I open Software Center on the client to install the program, it fails.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14387" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-2.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 2" width="500" height="279" />

In this case, the error seems to be pretty clear, but let’s dig into the logs to be sure. First, we are deploying a package and program, so we need to look at the execmgr.log.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14388" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-3.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 3" width="500" height="121" />
We can see from the execmgr.log that the content for this program is not available on the distribution point. I am pretty confident that I distributed the content for the package, but to be sure let’s look at the <a title="Microsoft SCCM" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/configuration-manager-sccm">SCCM</a> console. Content Distribution status is shown in the Monitoring workspace and in the Distribution Status | Content Status node.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14389" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-4.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 4" width="500" height="154" />

The content for our package is on the distribution point, but why does the client think that it is not available? We know from the Technical Reference for Log Files in Configuration Manager that the cas.log on the client has information about content being downloaded to the client cache. Let’s look at the cas.log for more information.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14390" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-5.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 5" width="500" height="210" />

No warnings or errors are highlighted, but we do see an interesting log entry: “The number of discovered DPs (Including Branch DP and Multicast) is 0.”

If a client cannot discover a distribution point, there is a good chance it relates to boundaries. Based on the information in the logs so far, let’s investigate the configuration of boundaries in the environment. My lab is very simple, so I have a single boundary and a single boundary group.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14391" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-6.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 6" width="500" height="114" />

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14392" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-7.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 7" width="500" height="99" />

After looking at the boundary groups again, the problem with the program deployment is definitely a configuration issue. The Lab – Content boundary group does not have a site system designated for content.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14393" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-8.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 8" width="427" height="394" />

I added the distribution point to the boundary group and tried the deployment again. This time it was a complete success.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14394" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/sccm-troubleshooting-101-9.png" alt="SCCM Troubleshooting 101 9" width="500" height="171" />

This is just one example of using log files and the Monitoring workspace in the SCCM console to troubleshoot and resolve errors. Hopefully this provides a foundation for any SCCM troubleshooting you need to do. If you are still having trouble with SCCM and troubleshooting errors, SWC’s Microsoft System Center team has extensive experience with SCCM and is ready to help you with all of your troubleshooting needs.

		<title>What&#039;s New for Business Intelligence and Analytics in 2015</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The field of <a title="Chicago Business Intelligence" href="/solutions/business-intelligence">Business Intelligence</a> has been progressing at a rapid pace over the past few years. New tools and technologies are making it even easier for end users to quickly gain insights into the business in order to make critical decisions supporting organizational goals and initiatives. Read my blog about what’s new for business intelligence and analytics in 2015 to learn more.

Recently new business intelligence players have come to the market providing users with dashboard and reporting tools that include advanced visualizations. The customers we work with are very excited about the advances in mapping capabilities so that they can see aspects of their business across the globe and drill down to local levels; even layering additional public data such as median household income on those images so that they can make decisions about new business initiatives, marketing spend or product placement.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14534" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/business-intelligence-dashboard-team-analysis-report.png" alt="Business Intelligence Dashboard Team Analysis Report" width="427" height="322" />

Several leading vendors such as <a title="Business Intelligence Tableau" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/tableau">Tableau</a> and Microsoft are now integrating the ability to do predictive analytics within their solutions. We have had several local <a title="Chicago Business Intelligence Events" href="/events">Chicagoland business intelligence events</a> recently around predictive and have found high attendance and interest in this topic as more companies are trying to get their hands around how to leverage predictive analytics for a competitive advantage without having to hire a data scientist. Organizations no longer need to just see past performance and if they are meeting current KPIs. They want to model out the future based on trends so that they can be ahead of the curve in having the right product or service available at the right time.

<h3>Business Intelligence Solutions 630.572.0240</h3>

In the past few years there have also been many advances in mobile technologies and as such many vendors are responding with better mobile capabilities for BI. We have found that field representatives, such as sales and executives are asking for more dashboard and reporting access while on their phones and tablets, and vendors have been responding with better integration. However, rather than being a competitive advantage, we are finding this to be an assumed requirement of any tool and most players have addressed this need for the end consumers.

We have also been seeing an uptick in customers moving to the <a title="Chicago Cloud Services" href="/solutions/cloud-services">cloud</a> with two main drivers behind that: solution and hardware costs. Typically it is much more affordable to purchase user licensing for the cloud, then there is less of a need to have as much hardware on-premise to support that. Microsoft launched Power BI within the past year which enables organizations to share Excel spreadsheets, reports and Power View assets through team sites in the cloud. One of their key differentiators is the ability to interact with both cloud and on-premise data which has been important for many customers who still have concerns about putting sensitive data in the cloud. However, within our customer base this seems to be a continued trend that is under consideration for the near future.

For any organization it is important to have a robust data context with high data quality as the foundation for any BI initiative. We have found that many companies will adopt a new tool for the front end, but neglect the data itself, rendering amazing charts and graphs with bad data and therefore making bad decisions. More and more customers have been working with us on master data and data quality strategies enabling them to have one centralized clean version of the truth for all reporting and analytics. We feel with all of the disparate systems, sources and higher volumes of information, including Big Data that this will continue to be a key concern for organizations in the near term.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At <a title="IT Solutions Provider" href="http://www.swc.com">IT solutions provider</a>, SWC, we often get asked if it is possible to move a virtual machine from an existing on-premise Hyper-V environment into Microsoft Azure. The answer is yes! It’s actually an easy process using <a title="System Center Virtual Machine Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/virtual-machine-manager-app-controller">Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager</a> and System Center App Controller. Read my blog to learn more and see how this can be done.
<h2>Instructions for how to move Hyper-V Virtual Machine into Microsoft Azure using System Center:</h2>
Before you start, make sure that Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manger has been connected to your <a title="Microsoft Hyper-V" href="/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v">Hyper-V</a> environment and that App Controller is linked to both your VMM server and Microsoft Azure. It is also recommended that you pre-create any Azure networks, <a title="SWC Cloud Services" href="/solutions/cloud-services">cloud services</a> and storage groups that you might need. If you need assistance with the setup of either the System Center application or 

<strong>Once everything has been configured, follow these steps to migrate a virtual machine:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Login to App Controller and find the virtual machine that you would like to migrate.</li>
	<li>Once the correct virtual machine is highlighted, click Store at the top of the page. When you store the virtual machine it will shut it down, so please make sure that you have scheduled downtime before starting this procedure.</li>
</ol>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14549" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/system-center-hyper-v-microsoft-azure-1.png" alt="System Center Hyper V Microsoft Azure" width="500" height="163" />
<ol start="3">
	<li>Once the virtual machine has been stored, a new menu will appear and you can choose <strong>Copy</strong> to start the Azure transfer wizard.</li>
	<li><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-14550" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/system-center-hyper-v-microsoft-azure-2.png" alt="System Center Hyper V Microsoft Azure 2" width="201" height="365" />The Azure deployment wizard will usually include a warning. This is not actually a problem, instead it is the wizard helping you decide what VM size to use in Azure. App Controller will look at the specifications of the existing virtual machine and recommend the minimum size to get the same or better performance in Azure. SWC always recommends reviewing the warning and ensuring that the recommended virtual machine size is met or exceeded to have a good experience in Azure.</li>
	<li>To start the wizard, first click on Configure and select the Azure cloud subscription you would like to use.</li>
	<li>Next pick your existing cloud service or create a new one. The cloud service is basically a container that will hold the virtual machine.</li>
	<li>Next select the proper networking. As we mentioned earlier it is recommended that you configure this ahead of time using the Azure portal to make sure everything is ready for the migration.</li>
	<li>Finally, configure the virtual machine properties. You will need to do all of the following:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Name the virtual machine</li>
	<li>Select a size for the virtual machine (again consider the size recommendation from the wizard’s warning)</li>
	<li>Select your storage space for the virtual disk files</li>
	<li>Configure any networking and firewall rules you would like. If the server is a web server or FTP server, for example – this section would be the place to add remote access for those services.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9">
	<li>Once you have confirmed everything is ready to upload, click the <strong>Deploy</strong> button and then let it run.</li>
</ol>
Depending on the size of the virtual machine and the available bandwidth this can take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours to copy the virtual machine into Azure. Once the process completes the VM will be automatically started and will be available on the Internet and you can use App Controller or the Azure portal to further manage its settings.

Our goal at SWC is to be a trusted partner, helping you find the right cloud solution that matches your business needs and can help your organization grow. We work with a number of cloud vendors including Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services to ensure we find the right fit. SWC has an extensive technical background and cloud consulting experience, we know what requirements to consider when moving applications and systems to the cloud, including when moving to the cloud is not recommended. We can apply that expertise to your environment.

		<title>How Search Engine Technology Is Changing the Way We Think About SEO</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the holiday season right around the corner, it’s time to start thinking about what to get that person on your list who has everything. When I am stumped, my go to gift is always the latest and greatest gadget. What do I suggest this year? Read my blog to learn more.

If you really want to go all out this holiday season, check out the new Google Glass. Okay – so $1,500 is a lot to spend on eyewear, but you can guarantee that the person receiving this gift has never experienced anything quite like it. Among Google Glass’ many incredible features, the one most relevant to <a title="Chicago Search Engine Optimization" href="/solutions/digital-marketing/search-engine-optimization">Search Engine Optimization</a> (SEO) is its ability to listen to your request and not only respond with an answer aloud, but also display a visual. For example, if you’re looking for a place to eat, Google Glass will show step-by-step directions. You can also see an image of the restaurant, its reviews and even visit the website if you’d like. However this gets a little tricky when you’re browsing through a website in the corner of your lens!

Certainly <a href="https://www.google.com/glass/start/" target="_blank">Google Glass</a> has a long way to go before becoming mainstream. However, it is a huge step forward in the humanization of technology – and a good indication of where search technology is headed.

In today’s fast-paced world, technology is frequently changing the way people find and share information. In the case of our clients, technology changes the way potential customers find critical information about their business. As search technology continues to humanize – first with the smartphone, then voice-detection and now wearable search displays, we need to constantly change the way we think about <a title="Chicago SEO Services" href="/solutions/digital-marketing/search-engine-optimization">SEO</a>.
<h2>SEO for the Future</h2>
While we may not be at the point yet where we need to create websites that fit into a person’s peripheral vision, the days of viewing a website on smaller screens such as a smartphone or tablet are here – and have been here for a while. Whether you’re on the bus or at the bar, it’s easy to see that everyone is attached to their mobile device. Not surprisingly, it is expected that by 2015, searches via a mobile device will surpass those on a desktop. If your website doesn’t already have a responsive mobile-friendly design, now is the time to get one.

Adapting to new technology does not end with the look and feel of your site. As Google becomes more sophisticated, you’ll notice that many of your searches are generating engaging displays in the search engine results page (SERP). These displays also take shape in mobile phones, tablets and <a title="Google Glass News" href="/blog/technology/swc-featured-on-telemundo-google-glass">Google Glass</a>.

To put this into real-world context, say for example you are searching for “bulls” in Google. The Search Engine Results Page (SERP) will render much more than simply a long list of links. In my case, Google knows that I live in Chicago and my search history tells it that I’m interested in sports, therefore it has a pretty good understanding of my intent and will show me results for the “Chicago Bulls” basketball team rather than information about “bulls” – the animal. And I’m not just given a link to the Chicago Bulls official homepage, I’m shown the Bulls logo, a quick description about the team, its arena location, coach, mascot and division. I can even scroll through the team’s roster and game schedule. At a glance, I have access to pretty much all of the answers I need before I even click into a website. This is a great example of how Google is evolving from being a “search engine” into an “answer engine.”

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14559" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/seo-search-technology-chicago-bulls.png" alt="SEO Search Technology Chicago Bulls" width="500" height="399" />
<h2>Semantic Search for Your Business</h2>
The very definition of “semantic” is finding meaning in language or logic. In the example above, the search engine knows what I’m thinking about and the information I’m seeking simply from the word “bulls.” Today’s search engines can not only recognize keywords, they can actually understand the meaning behind them. So what does this mean for your digital marketing or even business strategy? It means that keywords alone simply won’t cut it. Optimizing your website for today’s search technology means understanding the way search engines are categorizing and indexing information on your site, as well as understanding your customer and the types of questions and topics they are most interested in.

Perhaps one of the most untapped resources of today’s website optimization is semantic markup. This is essentially HTML that can be used on the back-end of your website to reinforce the meaning of information and help search engines understand what your website is about. It can increase the chances that information from your website will be highlighted in SERP via knowledge graphs, attracting greater attention and click-throughs. Although this concept has been around for years, it’s especially significant in today’s world where mobile and voice search are becoming the norm – both of which rely heavily on semantic markup to extract information from the Web.

Although we cannot predict where search technology will be in the future, we are able to identify strong trends towards semantic technology currently being deployed by search engines, laying the groundwork for what’s to come. Perhaps one day, we’ll be talking aloud to pieces of equipment strapped to our heads; maybe that piece of equipment will transform from “Google Glass” to “Google Contacts.” I can’t say for certain what will happen, all I know is that my website will be ready for it!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two big challenges for IT today are the volume of help desk calls and the growing need for enhanced security. In the past these two challenges were costly to overcome, required deep expertise in non traditional technologies or were prohibitive due to the time required for implementation. With Microsoft’s Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS) which includes Azure Active Directory Premium, organizations can now quickly and efficiently achieve enhanced security and reduce help desk calls.

Enterprise Mobility Suite and Azure Active Directory Premium can greatly reduce the number of help desk calls your organization receives with self-service password resets. No longer are users required to log a ticket, call the help desk or wait for business hours to request a password reset. IT also doesn’t need to manage a third party product, since everything is based off of Active Directory! The integration between on-premises Active Directory and Azure Active Directory ensures all accounts are synchronized and resets happen in real time. All requests are driven via a web based portal within Azure that users can access anywhere and anytime. Once a user requires a password reset a simple verification step occurs through a text message, phone call or alternate email to ensure the users’ identity. Once the user’s identity is confirmed a verification code is provided so that the user can reset their password.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Password requirements will always follow your organizational polices defined within Active Directory.</i></p>

Enterprise Mobility Suite and Active Directory Premium also give organizations the use of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for enhanced security. As we continue to see a growing mobile workforce that requires access to data from anywhere at any time, it is critical to ensure that the users logging into your environment are who you think they are. Microsoft Azure Multi-Factor Authentication provides additional security that’s instantaneously achieved. Azure Multi-Factor Authentication can be used within <a title="Microsoft Office 365" href="/solutions/microsoft-office-365">Microsoft Office365</a>, Azure Administrators or one of the thousands of SaaS applications available on the market today. Authentication methods include – apps for Android, iPhone and Windows Phone. These are delivered as automated phone calls or text messages.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dynamic IT is changing the landscape of how we manage and deploy both software and hardware to corporate workers. Windows 10 is no exception. Microsoft’s newest iteration of Windows marks a significant milestone in its evolution and is well-worth paying close attention to. Read my blog to learn more about the new features in <a title="Microsoft Windows" href="/solutions/microsoft-windows">Microsoft Windows</a> 10 that are helping IT managers and decision makers stay ahead of the curve.

For client tablets, laptops and workstations, the <a title="Windows 10 Preview" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dn798751.aspx?ocid=wc-mscom-wol" target="_blank">Enterprise Technical Preview</a> of Windows 10 is currently available for download. The new OS should be immediately familiar to most users, as it was designed to cater to businesses and as such is modeled in the same vein as Windows 7 and the now-retired Windows XP. The most obvious and noticeable expression of this is the return of an enhanced start menu, which dates back to Windows 95! While legacy compatibility is important for continuity, there are many contemporary features to support new form factors, touch-based interfaces and high-DPI resolution displays. One notable security enhancement is the ability for BitLocker to containerize sensitive data so that it remains encrypted, even if it leaves the device.

<h2>Learn More About Microsoft System Center: <strong><span style="color: #f39000;"><a style="color: #f39000;" href="mailto:info@swc.com">Email</a></span></strong> or Call 630-572-0240.</h2>

Yet the revised client is only one part of the story. The Technical Preview of <a title="Windows Server" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview" target="_blank">Windows Server vNext</a> is also available and there are some significant feature advancements within that make it quite compelling – particularly in the area of <a title="Virtualization Consulting SWC" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/virtualization" target="_blank">virtualization</a>. Windows Server vNext will support rolling Hyper-V cluster upgrades, which will greatly ease the process of keeping a cluster current without having to rebuild it from scratch. Windows Server vNext’s Storage Replica can also perform similar functions for disks as Hyper-V Replica does for VMs – providing us with a game-changing approach to disk-based mirroring between servers. Finally, a Production Checkpoint of VMs is now application-consistent over and above a standard snapshot.

Need greater manageability? Download the <a title="System Center Preview" href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/server-cloud/archive/2014/10/01/announcing-availability-of-windows-server-technical-preview-and-system-center-technical-preview.aspx" target="_blank">System Center Technical Preview</a> (which will be released alongside the client and server) in order to leverage next-generation capabilities, termed Software Defined Everything as opposed to just Software Defined Networking. It is anticipated that this System Center upgrade won’t require a complete rebuild of the management platform either. But basic support for the new OS will be back-ported into the existing <a title="Microsoft System Center Consulting SWC" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-system-center/microsoft-system-center-2012-r2" target="_blank">Microsoft System Center 2012 R2</a> offering.

With constant change happening at breakneck speeds, some of you may be cautious about rapidly adopting the newest and latest technologies. Windows 10 is not completely new, all of the core Win32 API functions that business-critical apps have relied on for decades are still present within the OS and accounted for. This means the majority of existing software should work right out the gate and many of the other OS functions have been compartmentalized in order to cater to the form factors of different device types, such as tablets and smartphones.

<strong>The bottom line is:</strong> Windows 10 is a mature product at its core that continues to grow with new features and increase usability.

There are many reasons why you should start thinking about your organization’s transition into the next generation of Windows.

		<title>Microsoft SharePoint Helps Empower and Enable Users at M. Holland</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft SharePoint is a market leading search, portal and content management platform used by nearly eighty percent of Fortune 500 companies and millions worldwide to improve workforce collaboration, efficiency and productivity. For years, SWC has helped create <a title="SWC Sharepoint Solutions" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint solutions</a> that are engaging, easy to use and increase user adoption. Watch our client success video case study to learn about how SWC helped M. Holland find success by making SharePoint look good and perform well for their users.

<a title="M Holland Microsoft Sharepoint Enablement By SWC" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/s6UYIs9Pxuw?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-sharepoint-enablement.png" alt="Microsoft SharePoint Enablement" width="500" height="281" /></a>

M. Holland is the largest privately held thermoplastic resin distributor in North America with a rich history and more than 60 years of experience. One of the challenges the company faced last year was a reinvention of the intranet – a place where employees can go for company information, such as important documents needed to do their jobs more efficiently. M. Holland engaged SWC to help design a compelling user experience and intranet site that would be aesthetically pleasing and get more robust over time.

Prior to the reinvention of the intranet, SharePoint was an underutilized platform and it largely became a public drive for M. Holland. The new intranet gives employees a more robust experience, offering the ability to quickly retrieve and share company information. The M. Holland team now has quick links to the key information and documents they need to do their jobs more efficiently and effectively. The intranet has also become a center point for employee communication. There is now consistency when the company rolls out announcements to the organization using SharePoint.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-14878 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Success.png" alt="SWC Sharepoint Example" width="500" height="278" />
<blockquote>“What SWC did that we had not experienced before was they wanted to see how the average user was going to use the site and help develop it around them.”

<strong>– Pete Nutley, VP of Operations</strong></blockquote>
The thought leadership around how you architect one of those experiences to make it engaging for the user has proven to be SWC’s strong suit. SWC has been more than just a technology solutions provider to M. Holland, we are a trusted partner. It has been a great experience working together to enable M. Holland's business and empower their employees.
<blockquote>“They are not just a technical deliverer, they deliver on spirit and dream and intent and all of those other things.”

<strong>– Neil Goodrich, IT Manager</strong></blockquote>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On December 11th, an interesting new feature in <a title="Azure Cloud Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a> called RemoteApp will be available for general use. Azure RemoteApp is Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Services in the cloud and offers a number of features to make your applications and services globally available. Read my blog to learn more about RemoteApp and how this new feature will benefit your organization.
<h2>How Can RemoteApp Help Me?</h2>
Microsoft has worked with a number of customers and realized that many organizations are looking for ways to more easily centralize and publish applications. With the ever increasing number of people teleworking and companies implementing Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policies it is more important than ever for organizations to be able to track application installation while still making sure that end users have the tools they need. RemoteApp solves these problems by allowing organizations to publish applications to almost any device with an Internet connection including Windows and Mac workstations, Android phones and tablets and iOS devices. These published applications are also streamed from the server so that they no longer need to be installed on individual machines, reducing the load on the IT department and simplifying licensing management.
&nbsp;
<h2>How Does RemoteApp Work?</h2>
RemoteApp relies on the same Remote Desktop Services technology that on-premises terminal servers use. However, RemoteApp takes it a step further and publishes the applications from these servers to an easy to use application. IT staff no longer needs to monitor and maintain a large RDS environment – Azure does all of the heavy lifting.

In addition, hosting your applications in Azure allows your organization to take advantage of the high availability of Azure’s infrastructure. Your RemoteApp infrastructure is extremely redundant and will be active even if your on-premises environment is down. This can benefit the end users not just for day to day use, but also in disaster scenarios where many users are without a workstation. If they are running their applications from the cloud, users can install the RemoteApp client on any machine and will have their applications ready in a matter of minutes.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-15026 size-medium" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Microsoft-Remote-App-300x287.png" alt="Microsoft RemoteApp" width="300" height="287" />
<h2>What Applications Can I Publish in RemoteApp?</h2>
RemoteApp has two different models – a “Quick Create” option and a “Create with VPN” option. Using “Quick Create,” a number of templates are available from Microsoft including one that includes Office 2013 pre-installed. Using these templates allows an organization to deploy RemoteApp within minutes and start publishing Office right away. RemoteApp does not include Office licensing so you will need to provide your own, however if you are running a version of <a title="Microsoft Office 365 Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365" target="_blank">Office 365</a> that includes Office ProPlus you can use that license for RemoteApp.

For more advanced deployments, the “Create with VPN” option allows for RemoteApp to be connected back to your on-premises environment. The server used for this deployment can also be customized to include any of your custom applications such as Adobe products, Quickbooks or any other third party business applications. These applications can use the VPN tunnel to connect back to your on-premises domain, file servers and application servers so that you can continue to have the full RDS experience while in Azure.
<h2>How Is RemoteApp Licensed?</h2>
RemoteApp is licensed on a per user basis and users can receive two types of license – Basic or Standard. Basic licenses are for lighter weight applications such as Adobe Acrobat Reader, remote desktop services and text based third party applications. Standard licenses are designed for applications that may require more resources such as Office, Quickbooks and Adobe design products. RemoteApp also allows three different environments to be created so that some users can have basic licenses, some can have standard licenses and the published applications and type of RemoteApp deployment (Quick Create or Create with VPN) can be customized to fit each user’s needs. Keep in mind, with RemoteApp recently becoming generally available, some of the pricing and details are still in transition and this information might change.

If you are looking for a way to publish applications to your users or setup an easy way to keep your applications centralized and updated, let SWC work with you to investigate whether RemoteApp is a good fit for your organization. <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">Email SWC</a> for more information or call 630.572.0240.

<p style="text-align: left;">Don’t forget to make a list, check it twice and then back it up in the <a title="Cloud Backup" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">cloud</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And if that list is too long, consider making a pivot table using <a title="Microsoft SQL 2012" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012" target="_blank">SQL</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just make sure that your data is <a title="Cloud Security Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/security-services" target="_blank">secure</a>, we wouldn’t want a Grinch to steal it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No matter how you celebrate, take lots of photos and then share them with all your contacts in <a title="Customer Relationship Management" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm" target="_blank">CRM </a>or post them on <a title="Microsoft Sharepoint" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint" target="_blank">SharePoint</a>. Just make sure they’re HR appropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This year, we wish you enjoyable times with family and friends.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">May your chestnuts roast on an open fire and not your <a title="Managed Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/managed-services" target="_blank">servers</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow… but not enough to shut down your call center.</p>

			<title>Deployments and Rollbacks in Azure</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[There was a time when deploying software was a time consuming, manual and stressful process. We would spend hours and sometimes days configuring release scripts with associated stops and starts for manual intervention to ensure the highest level of quality all the while ensuring that we always had a backup plan for rolling it back out if something went wrong. Even if everything did go well, a tester could derail the entire operation and trigger hours of work for a team responsible for executing a rollback procedure in the middle of the night... there's a reason Release Managers are hard to find! But those days are gone. Read my blog to learn more about how Microsoft Azure has revolutionized the way we think about deployments.
	
	Azure is Microsoft’s <a title="Microsoft Cloud Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">cloud platform</a> for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) that has revolutionized the way we think about deployments. Sure, we have made progress over the years and improved our scripts, environments and procedures to reduce manual intervention and enforce quality. But software deployment planning and execution has been optimized significantly with Microsoft Azure’s new service offerings.<strong>Let’s Consider a Real-World Scenario</strong>
	
	<em>Multiple developer teams check code into a repository throughout the day. The application is built, tested, and deployed to an integration server automatically with no manual intervention.</em>
	
	When the release is ready to be shipped, the code is deployed to a new QA environment, where software is installed and configured dynamically using the PowerShell Desired State Configuration extension. As the code is promoted through the environments, the process is considerably more hands-off (i.e. by using Agentless deployments) than it once was, but still gives release managers and testers the opportunity to validate the software in the QA and UAT environments and gate when it's ready.
	
	Prior to going to Production, code is deployed to a staging deployment "slot" using secure connections via SSL. The staging environment is warmed up and connected to live data sources where it's subjected to one last round of testing. When the team gives the “okay” to go live, the staging slot is "swapped" for the production slot and is instantly live. The previous production slot is saved as the "last known good site" and can be restored just as easily as it was replaced.
	
	In the process of going live, traffic redirection was seamless, no connections were dropped and there was no need to communicate unavailability to the applications consumers.
	
	<em>Admittedly, there was some work to make all of this magic happen, but the time saved and the ease of mind Azure brings through virtually eliminating problems introduced by manual errors or missed steps is well worth the investment.</em>
	
	Azure truly provides the opportunity to make software deployments a non-event so that you can focus on what really matters – the end user experience. If you want to hear more about Microsoft Azure's release management capabilities, or are interested in a one day free on-site assessment detailing what it would take to move to Azure and confirm the return on investment, please <a href="mailto:Ben.Brock@swc.com">contact Ben Brock</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lots of rebranding has been taking place with Microsoft products recently. Windows Azure is now Microsoft Azure, Windows Intune is now Microsoft Intune, System Center Advisor is now Azure Operational Insights and Microsoft Lync is now <a title="Skype for Business" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365/lync-online" target="_blank">Skype for Business</a>. Finally, Windows 9 is being skipped entirely and we’re going straight to <a title="Microsoft Windows" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-windows" target="_blank">Windows 10</a> (now in preview). With all these name changes, it’s hard to keep track of what’s what anymore. Read my blog to learn more about what we can expect from Microsoft in 2015.The names may be changing, but the story still remains largely the same. Each of the products I mentioned above still do what they were written to do, many have just become <a title="Microsoft Cloud" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">cloud-based versions</a> of the equivalent on-premises software. The benefit is that new features are being added to make your daily IT tasks easier and more efficient. <a title="Microsoft System Center 2012 R2" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-system-center/microsoft-system-center-2012-r2" target="_blank">Microsoft System Center 2012 R2</a> is a powerful datacenter automation and orchestration platform for managing your private cloud while integrating with your public cloud services. With the nature of the cloud these days, you might be wondering if you even need to deploy System Center on-premises anymore or how the new versions of Windows Server will affect your organization. For now, a hybrid approach consisting of both private and public cloud utilization is still a good IT strategy. There is no one-size-fits-all, and each paradigm has its own set of strengths and limitations.
	
	Microsoft’s Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS) is a compelling offering for Microsoft Azure, Intune and Rights Management that offers businesses a comprehensive set of tools for managing identity, information and infrastructure. Combined with <a title="Microsoft Office 365" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365" target="_blank">Office 365 for Business</a>, EMS gives you a complete cloud-centric IT approach for a large part of your service needs for both employees and customers.
	
	But what about those who still need local devices to interact with these cloud services, i.e. smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops. In order to deploy standardized operating system images on these devices, an on-premises tool such as System Center Configuration Manager is critical to executing these roll outs on your subnets. Similarly, while you can use Microsoft Lync in Office 365 for IM and presence, if you’re looking to replace your aging PBX and telephone systems, you’ll still need onsite <a title="Microsoft Unified Communications" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/unified-communications" target="_blank">Unified Communication</a> servers to connect to your SIP trunk provider for audio and video conferencing.
	
	In summary, both the private cloud and the public cloud are needed. One cannot exist without the other. As such, your organization needs to have a comprehensive strategy that incorporates both elements in an effective and unified manner. SWC can help your business understand the rapid pace of Dynamic IT, so that you are better able navigate and adapt to the changing landscape and succeed in transitioning your network into the next level of IT.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a title="Microsoft Dynamics 2013" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management/crm-2013" target="_blank">Microsoft Dynamics</a> Marketing platform offers a breadth of new capabilities for today’s savvy marketer at an extremely attractive price. There is so much this platform can do for $125/user/month that you may get the feeling that it’s too good to be true. But once you do your homework, you will quickly realize that Dynamics Marketing has many of the same robust features you see in all of the top tier marketing platforms. Read my blog to learn more about all of the cool new features that come standard in Microsoft Dynamics Marketing, making it everything you ever wanted in a marketing automation platform.
	
	There are many blog and technical articles out there that do a deep dive into how to setup and execute marketing campaigns and many of the other capabilities in the Dynamics Marketing platform. In this blog I wanted to clarify some of the functionality and dispel any ambiguity about what this feature set provides.The <strong>Visual Campaign Designer</strong> allows you to design the flow of your marketing campaign with logic breaks, A/B testing and scheduling using activities and responses. It also allows you to see the results of your efforts by indicating the flow of the number of recipients affected through each message, offer or landing page.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-15140 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/CRM2015.png" alt="Visual Campaign Designer" width="500" height="307" />
	
	A few of the core activities and responses within Marketing Dynamics Marketing are:
	
	<strong>Landing Pages</strong> – These pages are easily created and hosted by Microsoft for you. Generally, these include a lead form which allows a prospect to enter demographic information for lead follow up and event registration. You can choose to embed these landing pages via an “iframe” onto your corporate webpage, then use messaging to drive traffic to the landing pages and measure how often users are clicking through to them.
	
	<strong>Scoring</strong> – Scoring activities conditionally affect a contact’s lead score based on their interactions throughout a campaign.
	
	<strong>Offers</strong> – Offers create promotion codes as a call to action for your customers. You can use offers to track how many times each code has been redeemed and you can also place limits on the number of redemptions available.
	
	<strong>A/B Testing</strong> – A/B testing allows users to provide two versions of the same message for distribution to a percentage subset of their target list to determine which version performs better. Then the system will automatically send the winning design or whichever messaging did the best to the remainder of the list.
	
	<strong>Triggers</strong> – Triggers allows you to conditionally react according to the delivery, open, click or bounce of an email message.
	
	Each of the tools can be dragged onto the Dynamics Marketing platform designer so that you can set the properties for that action. When creating an email, you can utilize the ‘drag and drop’ email designer to create an HTML email from scratch, or based off of a predefined template. The email designer takes a bit of getting used to and can feel a little bit clunky, but there is automatic validation that helps guide you through the process to make sure that you are including all of the elements necessary to keep you in compliance with bulk communication regulations – such as including a subject for the message, the required sender information and unsubscribe options.
	
	<strong>Campaign Execution Results</strong> are shown in near real time as recipients receive and open or unsubscribe. The open, click and unsubscribe statistics are displayed right within the visual campaign designer so you can see how the results flow through each campaign that you have created.
	
	The entire platform <strong>integrates easily</strong> with <a title="Microsoft Dynamic CRM" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm" target="_blank">CRM online or CRM on-premises</a> through an Azure hosted service bus. The integration provides a bi-directional sync of contact, activity and campaign information, which can be configured and mapped at a granular level.
	
	In the future, I will be creating more detailed blogs with information about how this platform leverages and integrates with CRM. In the meantime, feel free to <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">reach out to SWC</a> or attend our January 22nd <a title="CRM Chicago Launch Event" href="http://www.swc.com/events" target="_blank">Chicagoland CRM 2015 launch event</a> to learn more.

			<title>Preparing for Server 2003 End of Life by Migrating to Microsoft Azure</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/server-2003-end-of-life</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you still have a number of Server 2003 systems that need to be upgraded in your environment? Are you lacking the adequate computing or storage resources to make this a reality? Microsoft Azure may be a quick and easy way to get your systems up to date without having to purchase additional hardware. Read my blog on preparing for Server 2003 end of life by migrating to Microsoft Azure to learn more.
	
	<strong>In July of 2015, Server 2003 will no longer be supported by Microsoft.</strong> Many organizations still have systems running on the Server 2003 operating system and will need plan an upgrade path, however upgrading from Server 2003 to a newer operating systems can be difficult because most Server 2003 systems are running a 32-bit architecture. Server 2008 R2 and later require a 64-bit architecture. Therefore an upgrade may require a full reinstallation and most organizations do not have the resources (or the licensing) to perform this upgrade.<strong> Microsoft Azure may be an easy and quick way to get your systems up to date.</strong>
	Microsoft Azure is Microsoft’s <a title="Cloud Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">cloud platform</a> for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). The platform provides an alternative environment for new servers and offers a number of operating system options including Server 2012 R2.<strong> One of the many benefits of moving to a cloud environment like Azure, is that you no longer have to worry about installing and patching the operating system, Azure takes care of this for you and each of the virtual machines can be customized with an appropriate amount of compute and storage resources, so that you only pay for what you use on a monthly basis without the need to purchase expensive on-premises hardware.</strong> All operating system licensing is also included, eliminating the need for a license upgrade or new license purchase. And if you need to upgrade some of your applications such as SQL, that licensing can also be included in your monthly Azure cost.
	
	Another one of Azure’s benefits is it’s a high speed Internet connection to allow for easy communication to and from your servers. For a secure link to your on-premises environment, it is possible to setup an IPsec point-to-point tunnel between any business class firewall and Azure. <strong>For remote users, Azure also provides a VPN application for easy access from anywhere.</strong> Using these tools Azure can easily act as your remote datacenter allowing you to quickly and easily setup new servers and run your old 2003 systems side by side with your new 2012 servers.
	
	What if down the road you need to bring some of these systems back onsite? Azure makes it easy! You can simply migrate the virtual hard disk out of Azure and restart the virtual machine in your onsite Hyper-V cluster. Similarly, as your hardware ages it is very easy to migrate virtual machines from your on-premises Hyper-V into Azure to reduce your hardware footprint.
	
	Our goal at SWC is to be your partner, helping you find the right <a title="Cloud Services " href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">cloud solutions</a> to match your business need and grow your organization. <strong>We work with a number of cloud vendors to ensure that we can find the right fit.</strong> SWC’s team has extensive technical backgrounds and know many of the requirements necessary to consider when moving applications and systems to the cloud, including when moving to the cloud is not recommended. We apply that cloud expertise to your environment.

			<title>SWC Best Practices: Keeping Up with Today’s IT Environment</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is a huge amount of work that needs to get done day in and day out in today’s midmarket IT environment, as well as the strategic planning activities that need to occur. <strong>We have found that many <a title="SWC Managed Services" href="http://www.swc.com/swc-managed-services/" target="_blank">internal IT teams are overwhelmed</a> and complaining that they need <a title="Managed Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/managed-services" target="_blank">additional IT resources</a> to help them keep up.</strong> Watch my best practices video to learn more about why partnering with an IT managed services provider is a best practice for many midmarket organizations.
	
	<a title="Managed IT Services Best Practices" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Frv02sC66qo?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/susie-cummings-managed-it-services-video-player.png" alt="Microsoft SharePoint Enablement" width="500" height="281" /></a>
	
	When we say internal IT teams are having a hard time keeping up, it’s not to say that they can’t handle user requests or that they don’t know what technology to implement next. <strong>Keeping up also involves establishing a rigor and discipline around the everyday activities that need to be completed in order to advert business risk in an organization’s IT environment,</strong> such as making sure the backups are running successfully or the antivirus is up-to-date. The reason I mention these two things is because many organizations have no visibility into backups and antivirus and so they end up with a lot of surprises.
	
	We see it happen every day, all of a sudden a customer comes to us because their server crashes and they thought they had invested in a really great backup service that would get it back up and running in no time. What they quickly realize is that their service hadn't been backing up the data the way they though it had over the last couple weeks and now it's a huge problem. <strong>Most organizations have zero visibility into their backup plan, as well as many other IT surprises that are common in the midmarket,</strong> such as users whose desktops or workstations aren’t checking into the organization’s antivirus updates. All of a sudden they are panicking because a virus has started to propagate into the organization and the vulnerability is that they didn’t even know it was happening.
	
	What SWC Managed Services does is layer on top of an organization’s internal IT. We provide the rigor and discipline to check the things that fall under the daily IT production support related activities, so that you know they are getting done by a team of people whose job it is to do them. This way your internal team can focus on more strategic projects to help achieve your business’ goals.
	
	<strong>There are many benefits to partnering with SWC for IT managed services, including:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Leveraging a highly responsive team of IT subject matter experts</li>
		<li>Comprehensive coverage of your IT environment– on a 24x7x365 basis</li>
		<li>IT roadmap and strategy support for your business goals</li>
		<li>Cost-effective, flexible support options to fit your IT needs</li>
	</ul>

			<title>User Experience: The Makings of a Sustainable SEO Strategy</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the dawn of search technology, there has been a lot of speculation around how to achieve the coveted <a title="Search Engine Optimization Services" href="/solutions/digital-marketing/search-engine-optimization">first-page position on Google</a>. Understandably enough, Google has always been tight lipped about their algorithm by only revealing vague details around significant updates or occasionally confirming or shutting down popular rumors, such as whether social media plays a role in ranking – which Google recently sorta’ kinda’ debunked (more on this later). But even when Google gives us small glimpses behind the curtain, a sustainable SEO strategy does not depend on the unveiling of Google’s secret algorithm. I’m afraid Google will never let this happen. Read my blog to learn more about the makings of a sustainable SEO strategy.
	
	By now we know that a sustainable SEO strategy has nothing to do with “cracking the code” or “gaming the system.” As many can attest, past attempts to outsmart the search engines by using keyword stuffing or link farming ended with disastrous results after Google’s Panda update in February 2011 and Penguin update in April 2012.
	
	Of course, it is important to stay abreast on the changes we observe in the search engine results pages (SERPs) and draw conclusions based on the way search technology is evolving. For instance, when it comes to the theory of social media, Google has said both, “yes” they do use social signals and then more recently, “no” they do not use Facebook or Twitter in their ranking algorithm. But what about other social signals like Google+? Both Google and Bing have invested a lot of time and resources into adding social search functionality over the past year. Why would they do this if social signals weren’t important? Given these trends, it’s safe to say that social signals will have an impact on ranking in the near future, if they don’t already.
	
	With Google’s continuous updates and contradictions about what is and is not a ranking factor, it can be difficult to keep up. As SEOs, it’s our job to ensure we are providing our clients with the best combination of “signals” we have available at the time. Sometimes these signals are obvious – such as ensuring your site architecture is “crawlable,” while others are based on the strong implications and lots and lots of testing, such as social signals. Whichever strategy works best today, it will certainly change again and in the future. Heck, it’s probably changed since you started reading this blog! However, there is one rule in which Google has never wavered. As Google’s head of Webspam repeatedly asserts:
	<blockquote><em>"Instead of chasing after the search engines, chase after the user experience because the search engines are chasing after the user experience"</em></blockquote>
	<strong>– Matt Cutts</strong>
	There you have it. A good SEO strategy puts the user first at all times. After all, both search engines and marketers ultimately want same thing – a satisfied customer. As search engines continue to make significant changes to please users, shouldn’t your website be doing the same thing?
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-seo-stats-infographic-012015.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15447" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/swc-seo-stats-infographic-sm-012015.png" alt="SWC SEO Stats Infographic SM" width="500" height="764" /></a>
	Much like the vague details we get about Google’s algorithm, the term user experience is also extremely vague. Below I’ve laid out the two primary components of a website with good user experience.
	<h2>Quality Content</h2>
	Quality content may be the oldest trick in the book, but it remains the most important on-page ranking factor moving into 2015. In 2011, Google admitted to using real people to evaluate thousands of websites based on the site’s content. This type of human feedback has since been incorporated into the algorithms to provide better results. As search engines continue to build upon an endless collection of data, they become more sophisticated in understanding the kinds of websites people like. Bounce-rate and time-on-page are two metrics we can use to help us understand customer satisfaction. Keep in mind, a high bounce rate and low time on page in some cases means the user came to the site, immediately found what they needed and left – so it’s important to not rely on these two metrics alone.
	<h2>Professional Design</h2>
	In addition to quality content, people will form opinions about your brand based on its appearance – the search engines know this and have become extremely accurate at predicting and serving the kinds of websites that appeal to user’s preferences. A <a title="Website Design Services" href="/solutions/digital-marketing/digital-creative-design">professionally designed website</a> should not only have aesthetic appeal, it should also load extremely fast and take very little time and effort to navigate to the information the user is seeking. This is especially critical in 2015 – the year when mobile users are expected to surpass desktop users. Google has been dropping hints for a while that they understand the mobile user experience, and just recently started rolling out “mobile-friendly” tags in the search engine results page (SERPs) to indicate which pages will provide a good user experience versus a bad one. If your site is not built to adapt to mobile devices with larger font size, modified navigation and bigger buttons for touchscreens, expect to see a big drop in traffic moving into the New Year.
	
	Putting the customer first often means incorporating the latest technology and modern trends, as well as constantly monitoring and modifying based on the results. In doing this, you can better understand your customer and secure more return visits, site engagement, shared links and bookmarking – all of which are signals that get picked up by search engines. Interactive marketing is all about user choice and companies that respect the user will be successful.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft Social Listening in <a title="Microsoft Cynamics CRM" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management" target="_blank">Dynamics CRM 2015</a> provides sales, marketing and customer service teams with powerful social tools to help them connect with customers and prospects and determine social insights and sentiment. Read my blog to learn more about some of the exciting new features in Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2015 Social Listening tool.
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	Social media is a very simple concept by nature, so it only seems natural that Microsoft’s new Social Listening services are simple to setup and use.
	<ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Start by signing up via the <a title="Microsoft Office 365" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365" target="_blank">Microsoft O365</a> portal and administering which users have licenses for Social Listening</li>
		<li>Setup which search topics you want to monitor for social media buzz</li>
		<li>Sit back and wait for the data to accumulate as the platform “listens” for posts to be made that match the “include” and “exclude” terms that you setup in your search topic</li>
	</ul>
	</ul>
	<h2>Analytics Dashboard</h2>
	The power of the platform comes with the pre-built drillable analytics dashboards which allow you to analyze and identify trends. The analytics dashboards can be viewed directly from your CRM system dashboards, user dashboards and entity forms so that sellers and marketers can make decisions based off of metrics such as trends over geography and sentiment.
	
	One of the worries I initially had about the platform was that it would only search across social profiles that were previously setup in my CRM database. That is not the case. Buzz about your search topics are accumulated across all publically accessible profiles and you are only limited by your monthly quota of search results that are retrieved and stored for analysis. By default, this is 10k posts and you can increase that quota if needed.
	
	Unfortunately, the analytics dashboards and “listening” only starts once you have setup your search terms. You might have to wait a couple days or weeks to see any definition of trending. It will take diligence and some thoughtful planning to make sure that you are capturing enough relevant post information to be able to make decisions. You will also want to monitor and adjust your search terms frequently to make sure that relevant information is being returned and that you are poised to understand new trends over time.
	
	All of the items on the dashboard sample below are drillable down to the post level where you can see exactly what people are motivated to write about.

	<h2>Microsoft Dynamics CRM Social Care Framework</h2>
	Additional power comes with the Social Care Framework, which is a set of code libraries and a sample project that allows a developer to create a social solution that meets the needs of the business. This generic framework allows you to route social information into your CRM system in an actionable way.
	
	For example, would you like to create an activity for a sales rep to follow up on whenever someone tweets in regards to a specific term or hashtag? The specific implementation and routing of the actionable data can be customized to fit your organization’s needs. Subscribe to SWC’s blog, as I will follow up in my next post on what can be accomplished with this framework and how it is used.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[By now you have probably heard about the cyber-attack against Sony Pictures. This was the most devastating cyber-attack that we have seen against a corporation thus far. While we still don’t know a lot of the technical details about how the attack happened. We do know how the attack began. Read my “Ask SWC” blog to learn more about advanced malware protection, the Sony cyber-attack and how to <a title="Security IT Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/security-services" target="_blank">keep your organization’s data safe</a>.

	<h2>The Sony Cyber-Attack</h2>
	The cyber-attack against Sony started with a simple phishing email that contained an attachment. This attachment was a malicious piece of malware that was not detected by traditional antivirus software. Sony at the time did not have an advanced malware protection system that would prevent these types of attacks. We continue to see the same method of attack used against companies. While advanced malware detection is not the only solution that is needed, it is one that companies continue to overlook.
	<h2>Advanced Threat Detection Technology</h2>
	SWC Technology Partners has a security solution offering through our <a title="Security Managed Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/security-services/security-managed-services" target="_blank">managed services</a> practice that helps protect organizations against similar cyber-attacks. We assist our clients by building a solid security foundation that includes market leading security tools for malware detection, firewalls and Network Access Control. These tools are all behavioral based and help prevent exploits such as Crypto-Locker and botnets that traditional signature based antivirus software programs are no longer effective at detecting. One of our favorite tools is FireEye, a threat protection platform that can identify behavioral based malicious activity and stop advanced malware and zero-day attacks.

At this event, our security expert Tommy Montgomery, CISSP, ISSMP, CISM, GCFW and Certified Ethical Hacker will teach you more about the products, tools and tactics necessary to keep your organization secure and stay ahead of the bad guys.<h3>Recommended Security Blog Posts</h3>

			<title>Client Success: Preferred Meals Website Redesign &amp; Mobile Application</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/uncategorized/website-redesign-mobile-application</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[SWC worked with Preferred Meals to rebrand and build a custom website that is easy to navigate and provides a more user friendly experience. Watch our client success video case study to learn more about how SWC helped Preferred Meals find success though our <a title="Website Design Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing/digital-creative-design" target="_blank">custom website design </a>and application development services.
	
	<a title="Preferred Meals Website Redesign" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VEsL0weV-8Y?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/SWC-Video-Case-Study-Template-Preferred-Meals.jpg" alt="Website-Redesign" width="500" height="281" /></a>
	
	Preferred Meals is a school food service provider. They are a nationwide company servicing schools from coast to coast across the U.S. providing healthy, nutritious and safe meals to districts both large and small.
	<h2>The Project</h2>
	One of the most recent projects Preferred Meals engaged SWC Technology Partners to complete was a revamp of the Preferred Meals website – <a title="Preferred Meals Website" href="http://www.preferredmeals.com/" target="_blank">preferredmeals.com</a>. This project included changing the name of the company, rebranding the organization and building a website that was not only a “view only” website, but would also engaged the parents.
	
	Preferred Meals new website provides a tool for parents, as they previously didn’t have a strong connection with the parents of students who were eating their meals. The organization now provides a place where parents can go to find all of the information they need about their child’s meals. Parents can now search their state, district and school and are brought to a webpage that is customized with the school’s logo and has their child’s daily menu, weekly menu and monthly menu, as well as all of the nutritional information they need to make healthy decisions about their meals.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-15675 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/PMS-screenshot1.png" alt="PMS-screenshot" width="500" height="317" />
	<blockquote>I really enjoyed working with SWC on our website. Their experience, expertise and approach allowed me to feel comfortable and confident in what we were doing as a team. I love the site’s design and I am so happy with the copy, images… everything.</blockquote>
	<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>– Clare Keating, Vice President of Marketing</strong></p>
	<p style="text-align: left;">Another important element of the website redesign SWC had to take into account was mobile technology, so that users could look at the website on their iPhones, iPads and any type of mobile device. It was a really exciting project because the SWC team had to adjust and adapt the design from the website to a mobile device to be able to surface customers in both environments as more and more people are using mobile technology and not necessarily going directly to the website to get that information.</p>
	
	<h2>Success</h2>

			<title>Creating an Azure Environment On-Premises with Windows Azure Pack</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you have a number of users who are frequently requesting virtual machines? Are you constantly getting requests for similar demo or lab environments? Do you have a number of end users who need to manage virtual machines in your cluster? These are common problems that organizations experience. While many may think giving end users access to the <a title="System Center Virtual Machine Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/virtual-machine-manager-app-controller">Virtual Machine Manager</a> or <a title="Microsoft Hyper-V" href="/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v">Hyper-V</a> cluster is the answer, it’s not always a practical or secure solution. To solve this problem, Microsoft now offers Windows Azure Pack. Read my blog to learn more about how Windows Azure Pack can help you create your own Azure environment within your on-premises environment.
	
	Windows Azure Pack is a free add-on application that integrates with Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager to create an Azure environment in your on-premises environment. Using Windows Azure Pack, you can allow your end users to login to a web interface and spin up or remove resources including virtual machines, databases and websites. Just like Azure, all of these resources can be limited so that each user can only use a fraction of your total environment and each user is then responsible for managing their own usage. Windows Azure Pack also includes usage statistics and if needed, you can also define pricing structures so that administrators can charge back usage costs to individual departments and teams within the organization.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-15730 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Azure-pic1.png" alt="Azure-pic1" width="500" height="341" />
	
	The Windows Azure Pack interface looks similar to the current Azure web interface, giving a consistent experience across all sites. If you prefer, the Windows Azure Pack can also be branded using your organization’s logos and graphics to give the end user a more consistent experience with your internal resources. From within the interface users can also manage and request changes to their plan, making it easy for self-service.
	
	On the backend, the Windows Azure Pack integrates with your existing Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) environment for easy setup. Different clouds can be assigned to different Windows Azure Pack users to ensure continued separation of resources into their appropriate backend clusters. Virtual machine templates available in VMM can also be used in Windows Azure Pack to allow for a library of available images. Windows Azure Pack also includes a feature for Virtual Machine Roles which allows end users to select fully customized servers with pre-installed applications.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-15731 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Azure-pic2.png" alt="Azure-pic2" width="500" height="96" />
	
	If you are in need of a user friendly self-service interface for your on-premises virtual environment, contact SWC Technology Partners to discuss installing Windows Azure Pack.

			<title>The Ever Changing Landscape of Identity Management</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Managing your corporate identities is crucial in the hybrid IT world of cloud-connected devices combined with traditional on-premises environments. For a long time, Microsoft has had a versatile stack of software tools to facilitate identity controls, but the products have recently gone through many rebrands or renames, making it hard to keep track of them all. This holds true for the upcoming vNext version of the product, <a title="MMS Preview" href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-rebrands-identity-manager-again-and-delivers-new-public-preview/" target="_blank">Microsoft Identity Manager 2015</a> (MIM). Read my blog to learn more about Microsoft Identity Manager 2015 and the ever changing landscape of identity management.
	
	First a little bit of history: Back in the year 2000, Microsoft Metadirectory Server (MMS) was released, which then became Microsoft Identity Integration Server (MIIS) in 2003. These initial versions of the product built out the <strong>Synchronization Service</strong>, which to this day remains a core component of modern day <a title="Cloud Deployment Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">cloud deployments</a> by way of the <a title="Synchronize Directory O365" href="http://blogs.office.com/2014/04/15/synchronizing-your-directory-with-office-365-is-easy/" target="_blank">Office 365 DirSync</a> tool. It is also the “magic under the hood” behind the <a title="Synchronization Services O365" href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/meamcs/archive/2013/02/18/sharepoint-2010-2013-user-profile-synchronization.aspx" target="_blank">User Profile Synchronization Service</a> in <a title="Microsoft Sharepoint" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint" target="_blank">SharePoint </a>Server. For customizability to interface with in-house Line-of-Business (LoB) applications, extensibility modules could be written using C# and VBS code, compiled into Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs).
	
	By 2007, this small but powerful tool morphed again into Microsoft Identity Lifecycle Manager Server (ILM) before becoming more well-known as Forefront Identity Manager (FIM) in 2010. These versions added a graphical web portal known as the <strong>FIM Service</strong>, which extended the capabilities of the product by allowing policy-based decision trees and workflow processes to manipulate <a title="FIM Overview" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff621362(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank">metaverse</a> properties. Support continued to be added for connectivity to additional external systems, so identities could be linked across databases, ERP, SAP, Human Resources and so on. Extensibility was further refined by incorporating <a title="Windows Powershell" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn640417(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank">PowerShell Connectors</a>, which made the product that much more robust.
	
	And now, with yet one more rebrand under its belt, we arrive at the latest incarnation Microsoft Identity Manager 2015 (MIM)! The new version of the product makes big strides in aligning on-premises identities in a cloud-based IT world. Some of these advancements have already been released as part of <a title="Microsoft Azure Directory" href="http://windowsitpro.com/azure/microsoft-azure-active-directory-sync-tool-gets-silent-release" target="_blank">Azure Active Directory Sync Services</a>, which simplifies onboarding to the cloud and supports advanced features like multiple-forest password synchronization with non-AD directories. And this is just the tip of the iceberg! When the full version of MIM is released, even the most intricate topologies will have a way to unify their private and public clouds in an automated and consistent manner.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[For more than 35 years, SWC Technology Partners has excelled at delivering technology solutions that optimize productivity, strengthen customer relationships, enhance data sharing and drive profitability. Learn more about SWC by watching our new corporate video.
	<h3>SWC Company Video</h3>
	<a title="IT Consulting Chicago" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xXxxfVUCQ_8?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Blog-Video-awards.png" alt="" width="620" height="380" /></a>
	
	SWC’s mission is helping midmarket customers succeed. We do that with technology and we do that with a lot of passion.
	We spent a lot of time trying to come up with three words that describe what we do at SWC and at the end of the day, it’s very simple – its <strong>business, technology, success</strong>. Our focus is working with our clients, understanding their business, developing technology solutions that help them achieve those goals and then we’re collectively focused on success. And that not only means success for our customers but success for our employees as well as they spend day in and day out at work and try to evolve their <a title="IT Careers at SWC" href="http://www.swc.com/careers" target="_blank">careers</a>.
	
	<h2>Chicago Area IT Consulting 630-572-0240.</h2>
	
	What makes our approach unique is our wide array of services that allows customers to come to us to put together a comprehensive strategy and have one partner who can put all of the pieces together. Our customers like the fact that they can count on a single provider to not only handle their <a title="Application Development" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/custom-application-development" target="_blank">software needs</a>, their <a title="infrastructure cloud computing" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">infrastructure </a>needs, their <a title="Digital Marketing Agency" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing" target="_blank">digital marketing</a> needs, but also their support needs. When we are able to tie all of that together and do it over 1, 3, 5, 10 years and continue to satisfy our customers, that’s when it feels great, that’s when our relationships are deep and that’s when the value of SWC really comes across.
	
	But it’s not about providing the services, it’s also having the mindset of how you can help the customer succeed. What are the innovative breakthroughs using technology that will create opportunities for the business or overcome the challenges that they face. One of the things that we really enjoy is solving problems for customers and it’s not really about a project, it’s about that partnership, it’s about solving customer problems or helping that organization grow in a certain way.
	
	And at the end of the day it’s about being a <a title="SWC Awards" href="http://www.swc.com/swc-technology-partners/awards" target="_blank">premiere IT partner</a> to our customers and helping their businesses succeed.

			<title>SharePoint On-Premises vs. SharePoint Online (Office 365 Cloud)</title>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some time ago, I wrote a SWC blog called <a title="Microsoft Sharepoint Cloud" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/microsoft-sharepoint-premises-or-cloud" target="_blank">Microsoft SharePoint: On-Premises or in the Cloud</a>. It attempted to describe the basics of <strong>“what is the cloud”</strong> and <strong>“what the implications of hosting SharePoint in the cloud are.”</strong> Since then, the world has continued to evolve and Microsoft has continued to improve its <a title="Cloud Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">cloud service</a> offerings to include <a title="O365" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365" target="_blank">Office 365</a> (O365) and <a title="Azure" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/microsoft-azure-reduce-helpdesk-calls-increase-security" target="_blank">Azure</a>. Read my blog to learn more about the benefits of hosting Microsoft SharePoint on-premises vs. online with Office 365.
	<h2>The Benefits of Office 365</h2>
	We are now seeing many organizations are moving to Office 365, often starting with a migration to <a title="Microsoft Exchange" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365/exchange-online" target="_blank">Exchange Online</a>, usually accompanied by an implementation of Active Directory Federation Services in Azure. This offers a great value proposition for many different sizes and types of organizations:
	<ul>
		<li>Top-of-the-line email services</li>
		<li>Much less management</li>
		<li>High availability</li>
		<li>Disaster recovery</li>
		<li>Overall lower total-cost-of-ownership</li>
		<li>Familiar end-user experience of Microsoft Outlook</li>
	</ul>
	As a result, we see a lot of organizations investing in Enterprise-level licensing for Office 365 (perhaps along with Azure). That means they also have full access to <a title="Microsoft Sharepoint" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint" target="_blank">SharePoint Online</a>, which is SharePoint 2013 hosted in Microsoft's Office 365 cloud infrastructure.
	<em><strong>Naturally, those organizations want to take advantage of the services they are paying for, but it isn't clear how best to do that without major effort and/or risk.</strong> </em>Most of these organizations already have some sort of internal (or on-premises) implementation of SharePoint, often an earlier version of the product rather than the current 2013 version. <strong><em>How can they leverage SharePoint Online without throwing away the investment they've made in the existing environment and, more importantly, without losing the content and information it contains?</em></strong> Well, there are only a couple answers. Since you can't do an “upgrade” (more technically, a “database attach upgrade”) when moving to the SharePoint Online (O365) environment, that leaves “migration” and “hybridization.”
	<h2>Option 1: Migration</h2>
	Migration refers to the notion of moving or copying (migrating) content from the existing on-premises SharePoint server(s) into your SharePoint Online environment. This can be done manually with out-of-the-box tools that SharePoint provides, including the “Explorer View” feature… but it can be a time-consuming and effort-intensive endeavor. Alternatively, content migration can be automated, either via scripting or any number of commercially available “migration tool” products. Tools can help do the job faster, potentially while preserving or even remapping the logical structure of the environment, but an additional investment in the right tool is needed.
	<h2>Option 2: Hybridization</h2>
	Hybridization is scientific term, which in the context of SharePoint and is intended to mean “implementing a hybrid on-premises AND in-the-cloud environment.” In simple terms, we're referring to the idea of using Microsoft SharePoint Online alongside of, or in addition to, the existing in-house SharePoint deployment. There are multiple ways to organize a hybrid environment and different “workloads” (or usage scenarios) that can be distributed across the on-premises and in-the-cloud environments. In some cases, you might leave the existing intranet, team collaboration, and document management sites in place on the old on-premises server while using SharePoint Online for any new use cases (sites, processes, communities, etc.) that arise. You might decide to move as much of the existing site structure and content to SharePoint Online as possible, while continuing to leverage the in-house server for integration scenarios that may not be available in SharePoint Online due to some limitations in the current Office 365 hosting model. You could choose to migrate your site collections from on-premises to in-the-cloud over a period of days, weeks, or even months, eventually decommissioning the on-premises servers once all the relevant content has been moved. You will then have completed a full migration to “in-the-cloud,” but you'll be in a hybrid state throughout the process.
	
	Whether you already own SharePoint Online (stand-alone or as part of an Office 365 bundle) or are considering investing in Microsoft's software-as-a-service offering of SharePoint 2013, there are a number of significant things to consider and decisions to make. Hopefully, this article has helped explain some of the options and their implications, at least at a higher level. Of course, SWC's experienced SharePoint architects and engineers are available to help you understand the details and make the best business and financial choices for your own organizations. As always, please feel free to reach out to SWC for any assistance you might need.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many midmarket companies have SQL Servers to support, but not enough work or budget to justify the expense of a full-time SQL DBA. SWC offers an alternative to complement your internal IT team’s need for SQL expertise. Read my blog to learn more about the benefits of a SWC’s virtual database administrator solution.
	
	SWC’s <a title="Virtual Database Administrator" href="/solutions/managed-services/virtual-dba">Virtual Database Administrator</a> (vDBA) Team has helped many Chicagoland organizations improve performance, ensure availability, implement best practices and complete project-based work for their SQL Servers. Since SWC employs a team of dedicated technical experts, we can complement your IT team and provide leadership with the strategic planning necessary to create a technical roadmap for future growth, consolidation and upgrades. Our vDBA service is a fraction of the cost of a full-time DBA.
	
	<strong>Virtual? What’s that?</strong>
	We’re glad you asked! While “virtual” tends to be computer-focused, our vDBA team is very real. However, they administer servers via remote access to your company’s <a title="Microsoft SQL Server 2012" href="/solutions/business-intelligence/microsoft-sql-server-2012">SQL Servers</a> from our corporate office located in Oak Brook, IL. This allows for 24X7 coverage of your core production systems and data.
	
	<strong>But what if my company has an IT fire and I need the DBA on-site?</strong>
	Should the situation arise in which physical attendance is needed, the service includes availability of one of our local team members to travel to your company within the Chicagoland area and surrounding suburbs.
	
	<strong>How do I know if I need a VDBA or if there is a problem with my SQL environment?</strong>
	SWC offers Microsoft SQL Server Assessments to ensure your SQL environment is optimally performing. The assessments follow best practice recommendations and help resolve SQL Server performance issues, improve reliability, cut costs and consolidate applications.
	
	The first step is completing our free online <a title="Preliminary Assessment " href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/managed-services/virtual-dba/database-assessment" target="_blank">Preliminary Database Assessment</a>. Following completion of the preliminary assessment, we schedule a meeting to review the results as well as a few recommendations to better optimize and support your environment.
	<h2>What does SWC’s vDBA service include?</h2>
	SWC’s fixed monthly vDBA offering includes:
	<ul>
		<li>24X7 monitoring of application health, hardware and resources</li>
		<li>Triage, analysis and remediation of hardware, OS and SQL alerts</li>
		<li>Daily maintenance plan output validation</li>
		<li>Weekly data and log review focused on performance improvement</li>
		<li>Monthly SQL health report and recommendations (growth, query, optimization, etc.)</li>
		<li>As needed server update installation, database code review and maintain service log documentation</li>
	</ul>
	Manage your IT budget by lowering expenses and investing in a vDBA to complete your team.

			<title>Creating Great Solutions Efficiently Using Open Source Frameworks Augmented by Some Homegrown Glue and Standardization</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/application-development/custom-application-solutions-efficiently</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[SWC has always been a framework company. When I started at SWC in 1988, we had a powerful <a title="Custom Business Application" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/custom-application-development" target="_blank">application development</a> tool called “Fast Programming” that enabled developers to build large complex business applications very efficiently. “Fast Programming” allowed developers to deliver full featured business application rapidly without reinventing any wheels project to project.<h2>Chicago Area Custom Application Development 630-572-0240</h2>In 1999, SWC embarked on an effort to develop tools and methodologies to build systems using Java as efficiently as we had done in the years of “Fast Programming.” The product of this effort was our Java Catalyst framework which we have now used for 15 years to deliver applications. Catalyst provides many of the same advantages that we enjoyed with “Fast Programming” including the ability to build complicated things efficiently, pre-built infrastructure elements and a standard way to build applications.
	
	When we built Java Catalyst there were not a lot of great open source choices for full featured frameworks.
	<ul>
		<li>Apache Software Foundation was founded in 1999</li>
		<li>The first version of Struts came out in May 2000</li>
		<li>The first version of Spring came out in October 2002</li>
	</ul>
	Everything was just getting started and we needed a solution that included a lot of out-of-the-box oomph! So we built Catalyst ourselves. The framework took advantage of some open source libraries but in large measure it is an in-house framework. Later, we built a similar .NET framework called Catalyst.net which likewise enabled us to efficiently build applications based on .Net.
	
	Fast forward to the 201x’s and the open source world is very different. There are now several very full featured open source options for frameworks and just about anything else you would want to build. There are great online resources, such as maven repositories, stack overflow, github and many others. None of this existed 10-15 years ago. There is a large body of quality solutions to almost any problem. These solutions have been built and debugged by a large community of really smart people.
	<h2>So how should an organization like SWC adapt our approach?</h2>
	For the last three years we have been building Java applications using the Spring Framework and .Net Applications with MVC and entity framework. Overall this has been a very positive thing.
	
	<strong>One thing you run into when you develop using open source is that there are choices… a lot of choices!</strong> Every problem has multiple solutions, each with pros and cons, each with a learning curve, each with potential incompatibilities with other choices you have made. On top of the choices, there are gaps. Capabilities that SWC had solutions for in our own frameworks that either do not exist or are implemented in a way that requires more time and effort than we are used to. SWC, as a software development team that creates many distinct unrelated custom solutions, cannot afford to figure out this labyrinth of options and challenges every time we start a new project.
	
	There is a solution to these challenges. We can build something that allows each new project to benefit from what was learned and built on in previous projects. In the past we just built all of the upgrades into our internal frameworks. With open source, it is similar but there are differences. We can build IP, but now we must work inside the context of the framework that we do not control. Using these frameworks, we have built base libraries to reduce/eliminate code that is redundant from project to project. These libraries will evolve similarly to how our frameworks to in-house did, improving from project to project. We also are standardizing on a set of open source libraries to be used. This reduces effort spent on project startup and configuration. This will not be a static set of libraries. We will tend to stick to tried and true component choices until there is a need to try new options. Libraries that prove to provide advantages will be added to our standard offering. Project standardization and rapid project setup is being accomplished by template and archetype projects. This means that when a new SWC project is started it will automatically be configured with the standard SWC IP pieces and the open source libraries we have standardized.
	
	This approach of selecting the best open source options, adding IP of our own to fill gaps, providing base solutions needed by all projects, and creating standard project templates and archetypes is enabling SWC to create systems using open source technologies with the efficiencies we enjoyed with our in-house frameworks. <strong>Building better systems for our clients at a reduced cost.</strong>

			<title>Don&#039;t Take the Bait - Tips for Protecting Yourself Against Phishers</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past few years, attackers have gotten lazy. Instead of constantly trying to find new vulnerabilities by fuzzing away at applications, they have decided that it’s much easier to use social engineering to attack your weakest link, your users. Users in general are happy to help out when an email comes in asking them to click a link, open an attachment, or even send over financial details for wiring money. With more and more being piled onto employees’ plates today, they rarely question what is being asked of them which leads to a serious weakness in <a title="IT Security Services" href="/solutions/security-services/security-managed-services">IT security</a>. Attackers know this and have decided to exploit this weakness. Read my blog to learn more.
	
	Enter the Email Phishermen, aka attackers who send malicious emails. There are two types of email phishing: general mass mail phishing where a large non-customized net is cast into the vast ocean of users with hopes of tricking a user to click a link, open an attachment or perform an action. Then there is a much more dangerous form of phishing called Spear Phishing. Spear phishing involves collecting and using detailed information about a victim using open source intelligence (OSINT) in order to further the chances that the victim carries out the requested action in the email. This intelligence information comes from benign places such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and even your company’s own website. Anything that you post online can be used in the attack. Once enough information is collected, the attackers craft an email with this customized information and send it to his or her victim. The emails typically contain a malicious link, attachment or request to turn over information or wire money. The body of these emails is written with information that the victim relates to and is thus tricked into trusting that the email is legitimate.
	
	<em><strong>Here is an example of a spear phishing email:</strong></em>
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16108 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/phish-email.jpg" alt="phish-email" width="500" height="300" />
	
	You’ll see in the email above that everything seems legitimate until we look closer at the details. The first thing that stands out is the signature block, the salutation “Kindly” is almost never used in the United States, but is commonly used by foreign attackers. We also see that the full name is used in the opener and in the message body there is an urgency for you to open the pictures. All things that are not normally included in casual conversation emails in the U.S. Finally, we notice the file that is attached that lists its extension as .JPG which is correct for an image file but upon further inspection, you will see that Windows is actually telling us this is a Screen Saver file. This is an indication that the malicious file is being masqueraded as a JPG file. Together these are all signs pointing to a malicious phishing email.
	<blockquote>Identifying phishing emails has become even more difficult as attackers improve their techniques. These same types of phishing attacks led to the recent compromise of companies such as Target, Home Depot, Anthem Blue Cross, Sony and many others.</blockquote>
	
	SWC offers a full <a title="SWC Security Solutions" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/security-services" target="_blank">Security Awareness Training Program</a> that teaches your users how to spot malicious phishing emails and files. Our courses will walk your users through common techniques used, how to spot these attacks, what to do if you receive a phishing email as well as general end user security best practices. SWC also offers a phishing service where we take on the role of an attacker and send phishing emails to your users. This service allows you to determine if a weakness exists with your users and to what extent the weakness exists. This service provides a real world experience that tests your user’s security in a non-malicious way before the attackers do.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-16121 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/security-awareness-training.jpg" alt="security-awareness-training" width="500" height="441" />
	
	SWC has had several clients who’ve been victims of phishing attacks and fake tech support calls resulting in Cryptolocked systems, infected systems and even intellectual property theft. After completing our Security Awareness Training Program, these companies were able to dramatically reduce their risk of falling victim to these types of scams and meet compliance requirements.

			<title>Twitter Strikes Deal to Show Tweets in Google Search Results</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Google and Twitter have joined forces in the latest “firehose” deal which gives Google full access to Twitter’s feed, allowing Google to index tweets in real time. If you recall, a similar deal was hatched but then later revoked in 2011, when Twitter took away Google’s access to their feed. Despite limited access, Google has continued to use traditional methods of crawling Twitter content for the past several years – a less than favorable approach due to the sheer volume of tweets published each day (around 500 million), making it impossible for any search engine to capture and index relevant tweets in real time. Now, with access to Twitter’s API, also known as “firehose,” Google can once again index tweets as they happen without crippling the social channel with too many requests.
			
	The two companies have yet to provide much more information for what to expect, other than a launch date sometime during the first half of 2015. But that doesn’t mean a frenzy of speculation and excitement hasn’t already erupted around the topic of social media and its future impact on the search engine results page (SERP) and <a title="Search Engine Optimization Services" href="/solutions/digital-marketing/search-engine-optimization">search engine optimization</a> (SEO). Read my blog to learn more about what to expect from searchable tweets in the near future.
	<h2>What Does Google and Twitter Get Out of the Deal?</h2>
	Before we jump into how this impacts your business, it’s important to first understand why the world’s largest search engine and the one of the largest sources of breaking news have decided to come together. Last year, Twitter created indexable landing pages for their top 50,000 hashtagged pages that Google and other search engines could crawl and index. So it doesn’t come as a huge surprise that Twitter is continuing to grow its relationship with the search engines by providing Google even more indexable content. The more tweets that appear in the search results, the greater opportunity Twitter has to grow their audience and hopefully steal attention away from the other channels. Google, in turn, gets real-time relevance from more than 500,000 tweets per day without having to wait for a breaking story to gain relevance across the Web first. Now, Google can index tweets as they’re happening and gain an edge over other search engines who can’t keep up with as much timely content. Not to mention, it is very possible that data associated with a tweet might help Google better tailor content and messages to their users.
	<h2>What Does My Business Get Out of the Deal?</h2>
	While it’s obvious that this recent partnership is mutually beneficial to Google and Twitter, what’s in it for us? If a tweet that goes out this morning could appear in Google’s search results that same day, we now have yet another opportunity to increase our brand’s presence in Google’s SERP by increasing our Twitter activity. It also means that, perhaps, one of the fastest ways to get timely promotions and content indexed by Google is to share them on Twitter in conjunction with updating your website.
	
	The impact that this new partnership will have on the overall ranking of your brand is still TBD, however it punctuates the importance of social media to your search marketing efforts as a whole and further asserts the role social plays in the modern landscape of SEO. The general consensus among SEOs is that there is no denying a correlation between social media and better rankings (note: correlation is not the same as causation). A good social media strategy relies heavily on a good content strategy, which should rely heavily on SEO. In other words, good content tends to be shared, and good content also tends to rank well.
	<h2>Start Doing This Right Now…</h2>
	Once Google and Twitter’s new “firehose” deal takes effect, don’t expect every tweet you push into the Twittersphere to go directly to the top of Google’s search engine results page – this would create disastrous results for the search engines and the people who use them. Instead, Google will have to create a method for determining which tweets deserve a place in the SERPs. Since Google values the same things people do, it makes sense that a tweet with higher engagement (retweets and favorites) will be more likely to show up than a tweet that receives little to no attention from fans. Therefore, investing more time in improving your Twitter engagement and amplification is an obvious first step in leveraging Google’s new Twitter deal.
	
	<strong>How to Increase Engagement on Twitter</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Quality content:</strong> Share content that people will want to retweet and favorite</li>
		<li>I<strong>mages:</strong> Studies show high impact images get better engagement</li>
		<li><strong>Hashtags:</strong> Increase visibility with hashtags</li>
		<li><strong>Length:</strong> Longer tweets tend to have higher engagement. You have 140 characters – use them!</li>
		<li><strong>Links:</strong> Include links when it’s appropriate. Always link to authoritative sites that provide value to your fans.</li>
		<li><strong>Frequency:</strong> The more active you are on Twitter, the more likely you are to make connections and gain new followers</li>
		<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The more you Tweet and track your engagement, the better you’ll understand what type of content resonates with your unique audience</li>
	</ul>

	As the indexing of tweets takes effect in the coming months, we may discover other ways to optimize Twitter for Google SERPs. Until then, preparing for the shift by investing more time in Twitter engagement is a wise move.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft announced last November that the next version of Lync will be branded <a title="Microsoft Lync new name" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/unified-communications/skype-business" target="_blank">Skype for Business</a>. This came as a surprise to many, but isn’t altogether surprising that Microsoft would want to align the two juggernauts. Alone, Skype’s statistics are impressive:
	<ul>
		<li>Over 300 million active and connected users per month</li>
		<li>2 billion minutes of calls made in one day</li>
		<li>140 million active Skype users on iOS and Android</li>
		<li>More than 300 billion minutes of video a year</li>
		<li>And Skype calls account for 38% of global international calling minutes</li>
	</ul>
	With Microsoft Lync taking the lead in new <a title="Microsoft UC" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/unified-communications" target="_blank">Unified Communications</a> deployments and Gartner’s positioning of Microsoft as the leader in their 2014 <a title="Microsoft Gartner" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/unified-communications/microsoft-leads-gartner-magic-quadrant-unified-communications" target="_blank">Magic Quadrant</a>, it’s clear that companies are realizing the value and reaping the benefits.
	
	Until recently, we didn’t have a firm release date for Skype for Business other than the first half of 2015. It has now been announced that we can expect both the on-premises and online releases in May (according to Microsoft insiders, but could be as soon as April)! Stay tuned as we will discuss new features, upgrade strategies and introduce you to the client over the coming months and please reach out to SWC or come to one of our upcoming <a title="Internet Technology Luncheons" href="http://www.swc.com/events" target="_blank">Chicagoland IT events</a> if you have specific questions about Skype for Business or would like to know more!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Buildings, parks, green space, neighborhoods, cities, water supply, energy works—these all comprise our <em>built environment</em>, or the “human-made space in which people live, work and recreate on a day-to-day basis.”
	
	As the built environment sprawls forward to fit a rapidly growing population, technology has become more and more essential in order to break down silos and direct architecture, engineering and construction (A/E/C) businesses towards more efficient and interoperable design, construction and infrastructure models.
	
	A/E/C businesses have long relied on reputation, trade shows and repeat business to grow, but advances in technology and interoperability have necessitated a change from these traditional models and marketing strategies. Now, your website is your portfolio, online reviews are your reputation and talent recruiting tools and content like videos and blog posts are your trade shows.
	
	In fact, 78% of US Internet users research products and services online —a number that likely will increase in the coming years. What’s more, <strong>B2B buyers have completed nearly 60% of the purchase decision online</strong> before even engaging the supplier sales representative.
	<h2>The New Outlook for A/E/C Marketing</h2>
	Just how important is <a title="SWC Digital Marketing Solutions" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing" target="_blank">digital marketing</a> to the A/E/C industry? In a 2015 Construction Marketing Outlook survey:
	<ul>
		<li>83% of respondents said they plan to increase their <a title="SWC SEO Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing/search-engine-optimization" target="_blank">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</a>, website development and social media tactics</li>
		<li>71% plan to increase content marketing</li>
		<li>56% plan to increase mobile marketing</li>
		<li>And 31% plan to increase paid search (PPC)</li>
	</ul>
	These digital marketing pushes aren’t just the latest fad, they represent a shift on how many in the A/E/C industry now approach their marketing and advertising strategy.
	<blockquote>Bottom line: if you aren’t meeting your competitors on these fronts, you may be losing business.</blockquote>
	SEO has been a particular strong push for A/E/C businesses and one that SWC places a high priority on when building and <a title="SWC Web Design Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing/digital-creative-design" target="_blank">redesigning websites</a>. Why? <strong>95% of search engine traffic originates from page 1 of search listings.</strong>
	SWC takes a user experience-directed approach to SEO strategy. In other words, SEO is not implemented for search engines’ sake, but rather for the end user. As Aaron Wall, founder of SEObook.com affirms:
	<blockquote>The success of a page should be measured by one criteria: Does the visitor do what you want them to do?</blockquote>
	Every step of SWC’s digital marketing strategy—from the design to the content—has the user in mind.
	
	As ideas like alternative energy solutions and smart cities evolve, so must the technologies that govern them and thereby the marketing strategies that make them visible.
	
	Join SWC as we showcase "best-in-class" examples of web design, SEO and digital marketing strategy at our next upcoming <a title="IT Events in Chicago" href="http://www.swc.com/events" target="_blank">Chicagoland event</a>.

			<title>What are Some Business Intelligence Trends for 2015</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/business-intelligence/2015-bi-trends</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[There are going to be a lot of exciting trends for <a title="Business Intelligence Services," href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/business-intelligence" target="_blank">business intelligence</a> in 2015. Watch my “Ask SWC” video to learn more.
	
	<a title="New Features of Tableau 8.2" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HJsGO-zR4mo?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Ask_SWC_Blog_Template.jpg" alt="Business Intelligence Trends 2015" width="474" height="262" /></a>
	
	<h2>Social</h2>
	When we talk about social and business intelligence there are two aspects to this. The first is that people are going to be a lot more social around business intelligence, meaning they are going to be collaborating around dashboards and different types of reports, sharing this information and having a more engaged, less static situation.
	
	Secondly, companies are looking for more social data about their organizations. Items are being posted on Yammer, Facebook and many other different social media channels and they are going to be bringing in a lot of that data to run analytics on what consumers are saying about their company, products or services, and also what some of their business partners are saying about them as well.
	<h2>Cloud</h2>
	And because organizations are going to have all of this vast data (and there’s so much data out there) you are going to see a greater move toward <a title="Cloud Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services?doing_wp_cron=1426780434.4199190139770507812500" target="_blank">the cloud</a>. The cloud is a lot more secure and it’s a lot more cost effective. Therefore, people are going to be putting a lot more of their business intelligence assets and data up in a cloud structure.
	<h2>Predictive Analytics</h2>
	Another trend that is really going to be taking off more this year is predictive analytics. More and more of the vendors that are out there today are making predictive analytics easier to use within new dashboard technologies, so <strong>you no longer have to be a data scientist to analyze the results</strong>. This also touches the ability to data mine and get ahead of different types of business trends instead of just being reactive and looking at performance or operational metrics. Predictive analytics is really going to become a big competitive advantage for your organization this year.

			<title>Three Pillars of IT Service Management</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/managed-services/pillars-itsm-service-management</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[When embarking upon the effort of <a title="ITSM Consulting" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/managed-services/it-service-management-itsm" target="_blank">implementing an ITSM framework</a> within your organization, centralize your focus on these three key areas: People, Process and Technology. Although it is perceived that the focus on these areas are often overemphasized in sales and marketing strategies, it is necessary to understand that it is not just the technology that contributes to a successful ITSM deployment, but the process of implementing it and the people involved as well.
	
	I’ve seen many organizations purchase the latest and greatest tools and then attempt to retrofit their processes and organization to the out of the box functionality of that tool. The result is always the same, the engagement fails and the tool often winds up as “shelfware.”
	
	It is only upon the assessment of each of these three areas – People, Process and Technology, in which a successful deployment of <a title="IT Managed Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/managed-services" target="_blank">IT Service Management</a> can be obtained.
	<h2>People</h2>
	Be sure when undertaking the assessment of “people” that you avoid the pitfall of only assessing the IT staff. A successful assessment needs to include the entire organizational structure as a whole. The ITSM mission and vision will fail unless it is embraced throughout all facets of the organization. In fact, an ITSM implementation often requires a culture change within the organization.
	
	During the assessment of your personnel, the following entities should be included when assembling your ITSM support structure:
	<ul>
		<li>Staff optimization (sizing)</li>
		<li>Staff capabilities (skillsets)</li>
		<li>Structure (appropriate support tiering)</li>
		<li>Communication channels</li>
		<li>Roles and Responsibilities</li>
		<li>Relationships between support structures</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Process</h2>
	Process and Procedures will need to be based on and aligned with ITIL Best Practices. The ITIL framework provides the best model for implementing structured, well defined, formalized processes. Ensure as well, that the processes are aligned with your organizations “business strategy.” The strategy should include the appropriate metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs) and service levels to allow for efficient maturity baselines and improvement targets.
	
	The processes should be structured to impose the necessary controls for optimization, yet be flexible enough to adapt to additional growth within your organization, i.e. repeatable.
	<h2>Technology</h2>
	To tie it all together, only “Best-of-Breed” tools should be considered when implementing technology within your ITSM framework. Those tools should include components for the critical processes defined and deployed within your organization. If you implemented Incident, Problem, Change and Service Level Management processes, then your tool of choice should contain subsequent modules for each. Although it is possible to operate with multiple tools, it will often detract from your ability to obtain acceptable OLA and SLA targets due to the integration components or manual processes that may be necessary to implement.
	
	The technology solutions considered should also possess the appropriate automation functionality that allows you to achieve the goals established within your processes. In addition, tools should contain the capabilities to synchronize to all other technology utilized by your organizations resources.
	<h2>SWC’s Approach to IT Service Management</h2>
	SWC provides end-to-end ITSM expertise, from strategy and design to transition and operations with a focus on continual service improvements. What sets SWC apart from other IT providers is our experience in all areas of ITSM. <strong>Backed by a team of ITIL certified subject matter experts, our services are designed to go beyond basic back-end support. </strong>We take a holistic approach to IT managed services by assessing your current state and providing recommendations on how to leverage the right people, processes and technology to achieve a more comprehensive and desirable solution.

			<title>Built-in Mobile Device Management Is Now Freely Available for Office 365 Commercial Plans</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[In what is possibly the biggest splash since the Wave 15 roll out in early 2013, Microsoft announced on March 30th that mobile device management (MDM) capabilities are coming to <a title="Microsoft O365" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365" target="_blank">Microsoft Office 365</a>.
	
	Today, more businesses are adopting a <a title="BYOD" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/managed-services/byod-polices-mobile-device-management" target="_blank">bring your own device (BYOD)</a> policy to support their users anywhere, anytime and on any device. With this support comes the necessity to deliver the same experience without having to worry about infrastructure, security, compliance and other factors.
	
	Some have turned to third-party MDM solutions for this support, but with Microsoft’s new rollout it’s possible that you may not need that third-party solution after all.  As long as you have an Office 365 commercial plan (including Business, Enterprise, EDU and Government plans), <strong>you’ll receive all of these MDM features at no additional cost.</strong>
	
	On March 30th Microsoft began rolling out new MDM capabilities that will help you manage access to Office 365 data across devices and operating systems. These features will help you:
	
	<strong>Secure corporate resources (conditional access):</strong> Set up <a title="Managed it services" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/managed-services/swc-best-practices-security-managed-services" target="_blank">security policies</a> on devices that connect to Office 365 to ensure that Office 365 corporate email and documents can be accessed only on phones and tablets that are managed by your company.
	
	<strong>Manage devices:</strong> Set up security policies like device level pin lock and jailbreak detection to help prevent unauthorized use and protect corporate data in the event a device is lost or stolen. You can administer policies within the O365 admin portal and view reports on which devices have been connected or blocked.
	
	<strong>Selectively wipe Office 365 data:</strong> This is perfect for when an employee leaves your organization and you need to remove corporate data from a device while leaving their personal data intact.
	
	All of these capabilities are powered by <a title="Microsoft Intune" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/microsoft-intune/" target="_blank">Microsoft Intune</a>, which provides mobile device management, mobile application management and PC management capabilities from the cloud. However, any organization can get advanced protection beyond the new MDM O365 rollout with Microsoft Intune.
	
	Microsoft Intune enables you to restrict user actions such as copy/cut/paste when dealing with corporate data and then, for instance only be able to save that data on the corporate OneDrive for Business account. It also allows you to <a title="BYOD" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/ask-swc/what-is-unified-device-management" target="_blank">manage devices</a> from the cloud or from your existing System Center Configuration Manager. Lastly, Intune can deploy certificates like VPN and email profiles on your device or to a group of users. You can even provide your users with a secure portal where they can enroll their own devices and install apps.
	
	These features are all very important in separating work life from personal life and preventing users from accidentally intermixing the two on their devices.
	
	Interested in realizing the potential Office 365 and mobile device management can have on your business? <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">Contact SWC</a> and we’ll put together an Office 365 and MDM roadmap that is specifically tailored for your cloud and BYOD business needs.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[As you know, we're all eagerly anticipating the <a title="Skype for Business" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/unified-communications/skype-business" target="_blank">Skype for Business</a> server release on May 1st. But in other exciting news, we now have a confirmed release date for the client! On <strong>April 14th</strong>, an update to Office 2013, <a title="O365" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365" target="_blank">Office 365 ProPlus</a> and Office 365 Business Premium will be available from Microsoft. This means that the first Skype for Business client is not a separate install, but rather a patch delivered to the existing Lync 2013 client.
			
	If you are using <a title="Microsoft Lync" href="/solutions/unified-communications/microsoft-lync-2013">Microsoft Lync</a> on-premises, your users will experience no visible changes when the client is patched. However for Lync Online, now Skype for Business Online, the users' experience will default to the new Skype look and feel. Of course, if you're running your server on-premises or online you have full control over what your users will see.

			<title>How to Get More Out of the Cloud for Less</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/more-cloud-for-less</link>
			<pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2015 13:48:36 +0000</pubDate>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’re thinking of moving to the cloud, the first thing you should ask yourself is “What are the benefits of the cloud to my organization?” Why should you, for instance, move to <a title="Windows Azure Pack" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/windows-azure-pack" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a>? The answer is threefold:
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Procuring and provisioning servers is done rapidly in the cloud. Your reduced “time to develop” and “time to market” means your IT can be much more agile in servicing the needs of the business units or developers.</li>
		<li><strong>Scale:</strong> The cloud gives you an almost infinite set of computing resources. Your applications will enjoy massive global scale, and can easily scale up or down depending on the demand. You use just enough resources for your needs—nothing more, nothing less.</li>
		<li><strong>Economics:</strong> You pay for only what you use in the cloud. This will save you money on apps that have variable computing needs.</li>
	</ol>
	<img class="alignnone wp-image-16494" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/OG-apps.png" alt="OG-apps" width="500" height="263" />
	The beauty of the cloud lies not only in its scalability, but its flexibility. You can choose how little or how much you want to manage. For instance, the Software as a Service (Saas) model allows the third-party provider to host and manage <a title="SWC Cloud Services" href="/solutions/cloud-services">applications in the cloud</a>, thereby freeing up your organization’s resources from daily upkeep.
	
	In the Platform as a Service (PaaS) model, developers gain a framework where they can customize applications. With PaaS, the provider can manage the virtualization, servers, storage and networking, while the developers can manage the applications.
	
	Lastly, in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model, the third-party provider hosts virtualized resources like hardware, software, servers, storage, networking, networking services (e.g. firewalls) and other infrastructure to deliver on-demand. You can choose to connect the “datacenter” you build in the cloud to your on-premises datacenter so that the datacenter in the cloud becomes an extension of your on-premises infrastructure.
	
	<strong>Before you move to the cloud, there are few things you should keep in mind that go against everything you have learned when architecting on-premises solutions.</strong> Keeping an open mind will let you get more for your money when moving to the cloud.
	<h2>Peak Load Time</h2>
	The first thing you do when you design an on-premises or hosted solution is figure out the peak load. Next, you purchase hardware that can handle that plus “X” percent. You need to overprovision, because not being able to meet the peak demand or future growth means that you will need to spend more on new hardware.
	
	Should you do this in the cloud? The short answer is no. It is not unusual for on-premises applications to utilize less than 20% of system resources. <strong>The cloud gives you the flexibility to scale on-demand. This means you only pay for what you need right now</strong>, and within minutes you can scale vertically or horizontally. You can save a lot of money by keeping the utilization of you system resources high, and scale up on-demand or automatically when needed.
	<h2>Pay By-the-Minute or By-the-Hour</h2>
	The second thing to keep in mind is that you will only pay for what you use in the cloud, by the minute with Azure and by the hour with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
	
	Do you have workloads that only happen at a specific time of the day, month or year? Think about only running the servers when needed. If no one is using your application from 6pm to 6am, shut down the server. If that is not an option, scale it down so that it only supports the reduced load experienced during those hours.
	<h2>End of Life</h2>
	The third thing to keep in mind is that Microsoft and Amazon update their hardware and add higher-end offerings year over year while continuing to drop prices. This means you will continue to get more for less and you will never have to worry about your hardware reaching end of life.
	
	Remember, the cloud is for everybody, but not for everything. You will get the most out of the cloud when you define your business and IT needs and adopt solutions that integrate with your strategy and on-premises environment.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[The CRM Maturity Model is a high-level blueprint for defining which level you are at in the <a title="CRM Solutions" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm" target="_blank">customer relationship management</a> lifecycle and what tools and strategies you need to get to the next level. From an organizational standpoint, stepping up a level in the CRM Maturity Model is a big deal. With each level comes a more detailed set of processes, a defined sales pipeline with centralized data and tools that allow different departments to synchronize and create a 360 degree view of the customer lifecycle. In essence, each level will likely create more leads, deepen relationships and increase the likelihood of future business, all the while consuming less of your time.

	<h2>Level 1: Ad Hoc</h2>
	At Level 1, sales professionals typically use offline tools to manage their accounts, leads, opportunities and sales tasks. Many times these “tools” are a large yellow notepad. The sales professional manages their contacts in Outlook which syncs up with their smartphone. At this level, each sales professional has their own sales process that loosely follows an organization’s process.
	
	<em>No CRM System</em>
	There is no true Customer Relation Management (CRM) system involved in Level 1. This means sales management has no visibility on what’s occurring on a daily/weekly basis without having meetings or calling sales professionals. These multi-person meetings are time consuming. The lack of visibility limits the extent to which the sales manager can help the sales professional deal with roadblocks, which is particularly troublesome if that person is new to the organization. The sales manager typically only finds out about a deal when the ink is dry on the contract. The rest of the organization has a limited ability to forecast the demand that comes from closed deals. In a services company, recruiting can fall behind. In a products company, the supply chain and assembly line falls behind.
	<h2>Level 2: Captured</h2>
	Organizations at Level 2 maturity have a CRM system where sales professionals are uploading their leads, opportunities and activities. Basic sales stages are being identified and team-based selling is starting to coalesce around the system. Data is now centralized; it’s not walking out the door when there is turnover. Sales managers can see a sales pipeline, trends and begin to help sales professionals with leads.
	
	<em>Value to Sales Professional – Familiar Tools Become More Powerful</em>
	With Level 2 maturity, there is Outlook and CRM integration. Sales professionals create opportunities or contacts in Outlook and link it to their CRM with one click—there is no need to go into a web browser. Using their phone or tablet client, the sales professional can use voice-to-text to quickly add opportunities and notes that will be created in CRM.
	<h2>Level 3: Managed</h2>
	Organizations typically at Level 3 maturity are using CRM’s workflow and rules-based engine to drive the sales process. The organization’s sales process typically has stages. Each stage has a set number of rules and data points that are required before moving to the next stage. One stage may require an NDA to be signed, for example. The qualifying stage may require the sales professional to confirm the budget or purchasing timeline.
	
	<em>Value to Sales Professional – Guided Process Reduces Sales Cycle</em>
	Every organization has processes, but when these processes are vaguely defined and loosely enforced, they can be the root of frustration and inefficiencies. Without these processes, for example, a sales professional may be told to go back and ask the potential customer for something they missed. Having the process clearly defined creates efficiency and transparency; the sales professional knows exactly what to do because they are guided through it all. This level of maturity leads to a decrease in the sales cycle.
	<h2>Level 4: Optimize</h2>
	When an organization has reached Level 4 maturity, they typically have implemented one or more of the following:
	
	<strong>1. Marketing and Sales Alignment</strong>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marketing and sales alignment occurs when you can make a connection from a marketing activity (e.g. email campaign), to a lead, to a qualified opportunity and finally to a closed deal. By implementing this alignment, the organization can quantify the value of its marketing investments and sales can be directly tied back to marketing activity.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Value to Sales Professional – Alignment Visibility</em>
	Now the sales professional can see how much marketing activity contributed to their sales. For example, CRM would show that a certain sales professional had 10 leads generated from a marketing campaign. The professional qualified the 10 leads to four opportunities. Two of those opportunities lead to a proposal of which the professional was able to win one deal. Those are tangible results that leads the sales professional to supporting future marketing efforts.</p>
	<strong>2. ERP Integration</strong>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">An organization at Level 4 typically integrates CRM and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) to pull pricing data into CRM. This reduces the risk of incorrect pricing and lost revenue. CRM pushes orders into the ERP which initiates production or allocation of resources. In this situation, sales is helping the organization forecast demand. Forecasting demand is a powerful organizational tool that is a constant challenge. Being able to forecast demand has an impact on the recruiting process (services company) and production (product company) in a manufacturing plant. The increase in efficiency leads to a stronger bottom line for the organization.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Value to Sales Professional – Faster Sales Cycle</em>
	Organizations often lose business because they can’t move fast enough to answer customers. When a sales professional has always up-to-date pricing and doesn’t need to wait on other departments for information, the sales cycle decreases. Level 4 maturity leads to less stress on the sales professional as they have more time to work the sales cycle.</p>
	<strong>3. Customer Service Integration</strong>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In most organizations, there is some synergy between the marketing and sales departments. However, there can be little communication between the sales and customer service departments. That all changes with Level 4 maturity. Many CRM systems including Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamics CRM have customer service capabilities. Imagine a world where marketing, sales and customer service work in tangent to manage the entire customer lifecycle. Marketing starts by nurturing the potential customer. Then, sales qualifies, understands the problem and proposes a solution. Lastly, customer service ensures the customer is happy and getting answers to their questions. This is true organizational alignment.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Value to Professional – 360 Degree View</em>
	In many organizations, the sales professional looks to the future because they don’t have visibility into how their accounts are being serviced.</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With Level 4 maturity, the sales professional gets to look at one pane of glass (their CRM website) for a particular customer that shows opportunities, recent activities, past marketing campaigns (nurture),and service tickets (current requests and issues). A 360 degree view allows the sales professional to deepen relationships, proactively address issues, and ultimately increase the likelihood of future business. What more could a sales professional ask for?</p>

			<title>SWC Scores Its Fourth Consecutive Crain’s Chicago Business Best Places to Work Award</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/careers/crains-best-places-to-work-2015</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the first things people see when they sit down to interview at SWC are our <a title="Best Places to Work in Chicago" href="http://www.swc.com/swc-technology-partners/news/crains-chicago-business-swc-a-best-place-to-work-2015" target="_blank">Crain’s Best Places to Work</a> awards. That’s very purposeful. We’re proud of these awards and we want to instill upon candidates the premium that we place on employee happiness and fulfillment.
	
	If you’re happy and challenged each and every day, then you’re going to deliver your best work, both to the customer and to the team. So if there is one overarching goal here at SWC, one goal to rule them all, it’s just that — create a fun environment that fosters professional growth and happiness through challenging, diverse and rewarding work.
	
	This is not a management goal, and this is not a HR goal. This is a team goal, and every employee is encouraged to contribute ideas that make SWC a fun and fulfilling place to work. We’re always trying out new ideas — from a company-wide <a title="Pi Day Celebration Video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP07Wlv3v70" target="_blank">Pi Day celebration</a> on March 14 (3.14) with a pie-eating contest, pi reciting contest, and plenty of pizza pie, to the SWC Olympics, a two-week company-wide competition with ping pong battles, Wii tournaments, dodgeball, talent contests and myriad other events.
	
	We work hard to find talented, passionate professionals. Experience is important to us. But we are also key on passion — on a candidate’s desire and eagerness to work with a team to solve an organization’s technology problems. And when we do hire someone, we want to retain that talented individual, cultivate professional development and be a mentor for his or her career goals.
	
	Our employees want to advance in their career. They are entrepreneurial-minded individuals who are eager to learn new skills and certifications, and we reward them for that. We reward performance with monthly incentives for reaching or exceeding work utilization goals, and we also reward them for receiving certifications, while covering any associated costs.
	
	The thing we like most about being named by Crain as a Best Place to Work is the process by which they come to select businesses — the focus of which is an employee satisfaction survey by a third-party firm. It’s not just me up here saying “We’re the best,” it’s the employees saying “We’re the best, and here’s why.”
	
	What makes SWC a best place to work? The answer is different for every individual, and that’s one of the reasons why we offer so many different <a title="SWC Benefits and Perks" href="http://www.swc.com/careers/swc-benefits" target="_blank">benefits and perks</a>.
	
	It’s an honor to be recognized by Crain for the fourth consecutive year—an honor that I share with everyone at SWC.

			<title>Encrypt Your Email with Exchange Online Protection and Office 365</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/encrypt-email-exchange-online-office-365</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[In an ever changing world where security has become more and more of a consideration in all aspects of technology, one area that we are asked about frequently at SWC is <a title="Security email encryption" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/security/it-security-worst-case-scenario" target="_blank">email encryption</a>. For many organizations it is necessary to send information that might be sensitive or contain personal data, but sending that information using standard email protocols can be dangerous. Even more importantly, your end users may not always realize the danger, and even with the best of intentions, some important information might slip into an email.
	
	There is now an easy solution for any organization that is currently on <a title="O365" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365" target="_blank">Office 365 </a>for email or who has Exchange Online Protection (EOP) for spam filtering. As an add-on to these services, <strong>Microsoft is offering Message Encryption to ensure that all sensitive messages are protected.</strong> Since this service integrates with your existing email system, the setup and configuration is extremely easy because all of your email is already flowing through the Microsoft services.
	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	Just like a spam filter, Office 365 Message Encryption scans every message that is sent out from your email system and looks for specific keywords or content. The rules for what content is discovered is fully customizable, and can be matched against specific words and text patterns in both the email body and attachments. Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, or just the word [Secure] in the subject are just a few of the examples of what can be monitored for and automatically encrypted.
	
	<img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/O365-EOP-blog-500px.png" alt="Microsoft Office 365" width="500" height="270" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16532" />
	
	Once the message matches a rule, Office 365 automatically converts the message to an encrypted message and puts it into the secured website. Instead of transmitting the whole message across the Internet, a message asking the recipients to log into to the email site is transmitted. The recipients view and respond to the email using the secure and familiar Outlook Web Access interface. Since this is all based on Office 365, no additional on-premises hardware or software is needed. Once the recipient responds, Office 365 Message Encryption can be configured to automatically decrypt the response and deliver it back to your user’s inbox so that they don’t even notice the encryption.
	<h2>What if the recipient is not an Office 365 or EOP user?</h2>
	One of the key benefits of using Microsoft’s encryption service is that it integrates with Microsoft’s Live ID system to allow anyone to login and access their messages. If the recipient doesn’t have a Live ID or doesn’t want to log in, a one-time passcode can also be emailed to them.
	<h2>How do I enable this feature?</h2>
	As mentioned earlier, if you are already an Office 365 or Exchange Online Protection customer you are almost there. This feature is part of the Rights Management Suite which is included in many licenses or can be added on for a small fee. To find out if you have the proper licensing and to get help configuring your protection rules, please <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">contact SWC</a> at SWC.
	
	Not currently on Office 365 or EOP? No problem. Transitioning to Exchange Online Protection can help reduce your spam and also provide you the added benefits of email encryption. <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">Contact us</a> and we will be happy to help you determine if EOP and Office 365 Message Encryption are the right solution for your organization!<h3>Recommended Posts</h3>

			<title>Manufacturers Look to Master Data Management to Solve Their Data Quality Problems</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today’s forward-leaning manufacturing companies are very agile and they’re making investments in their IT infrastructure. They’re investing in more applications and systems inside the firewall and lots of <a title="RemoteApp" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/microsoft-remoteapp" target="_blank">applications are being run in the cloud</a>. Now, instead of having that old mainframe application that they ran their manufacturing process on, they have tens of applications where data is spread across and they all have strategic roles on what those applications do with their data.
	
	Because of all of these applications, there is often redundant or missing data in, for example, customer lists. Customer lists might be in a manufacturers’ Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution, accounting package, CRM type system, etc. There may be different ways of codifying a customer within the organization. There might also be different ports and analytics. It all equates to a big data mess.
	
	Some people thought that simply having a data warehouse would solve this type of master data challenge. And data warehousing is an answer for some—it’s always helpful to have your analytics in one place—but what if this data is in such a poor state and needs treatment?
	
	Enter Master Data Management (MDM). MDM tools and systems help cleanse and ensure the governance of that data. These tools have approval workflows and permissions built into them to ensure only the right changes are being made to the record. It creates a central repository for all the domain-type data that’s important to the organization.
	<h2>MDM Solves Manufacturer’s Data Quality Issues</h2>
	When we talk to manufacturers about their information processes and data management, we always ask if they have a MDM strategy. If we’re doing any kind of data integration, data warehousing or <a title="BI Solutions" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/business-intelligence" target="_blank">Business Intelligence</a> (BI) type projects, we almost require that MDM be put into place alongside because it will guarantee the success of those projects.
	
	SWC has implemented a number of MDM solutions with manufacturers and because so many of them have Microsoft SQL Server, the MDM capability is already there; the solutions are pre-bundled with their SQL server product. It’s just a matter of us going in there and making the necessary configurations (Check out Chad’s <a title="Business Intelligence Data Quality" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/business-intelligence/its-the-data-quality" target="_blank">data quality</a> post for more information).
	<h2>MDM’s Impact on Manufacturers</h2>
	MDM is still very new for manufacturing clients, but it has been very impactful for them.
	
	When we have MDM conversations, it’s an easy concept for them to understand. <strong>I wish every software solution was as easy to demonstrate value and provide immediate impact. You just don’t see that with other software products.</strong> Many times you hear horror stories of how long it takes to implement a new ERP solution, whereas MDM can be done very tactically.
	
	There are instances where we went in and in less than a month we put it in place to do something tactically and provided immediate ROI.
	<h2>The Future of MDM on the Manufacturing Industry</h2>
	Looking to the future, I think the most challenging aspects of doing MDM are data integration, the linking up of applications to this model and setting up the subscriptions. I see that becoming easier to do and I feel like it’s going to be like buying an app off the App Store. It’s going to get easier to integrate your applications to the MDM strategy without having to write as much code or do so much data integration testing. It’s going to be more of a service.
	
	Manufacturers have a huge opportunity with MDM to map and manage data across multiple applications, organize data into multiple models and versions, and create cleaned, consistent data that is available to different users.
	
	We are just scratching the surface of what manufacturing can do with MDM.

			<title>Windows Server and Clients – Kernel Divergence</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Much media focus has been given to the forthcoming <a title="Windows 10 Release" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-windows/downloadable-windows-10" target="_blank">Windows 10</a> client operating system currently in preview form with an expected release in Q3 2015. However, there has been a lot of less publicized yet quite interesting news on the server front as well. What is going on with the long-standing Windows Server 2003? Should my organization be moving to 2012 R2 if a new version is expected in 2016? What’s the future direction of Windows Server?<h2>Chicago Area IT Services and Support 630-572-0240.</h2>
	Windows Server 2003 is fast approaching its <a title="Windows Server 2003 End of Life" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/windows-server-2003/" target="_blank">end-of-life date: July 14, 2015</a>. As with its companion client Windows XP, which exited extended support one year ago, this means that no new security hotfixes or maintenance patches will be publically released. Aging operating systems are more vulnerable to zero-day attacks and ever-evolving security threats, which can rapidly emerge in the modern cloud-connected world. <strong>Thus, if your organization still has active Server 2003 systems, it’s time to begin migrating their workloads to newer platforms.</strong> For 64-bit versions of Server 2003, it is possible to perform an in-place upgrade to <a title="Windows Server 2008 R2 Upgrade" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd979563(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank">Server 2008 R2</a> if necessary. However, a much cleaner and safer approach is to do a side-by-side migration directly to <a title="Server 2012 R2" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn303416.aspx" target="_blank">Server 2012 R2</a>.
	
	Because Server 2012 R2 has been broadly adopted and well documented for over two years, it is the most logical step for migration. Moreover, there is no reason to wait because Microsoft recently announced that <a title="Microsoft Windows Server Release Date" href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-pushes-windows-server-next-back-to-2016/" target="_blank">Windows Server 2016 will not release alongside Windows 10</a>. This is a noteworthy coincidence, as it represents the first time that the client and server kernels have diverged since Windows 2003/XP. It was nice that Windows 7 and 2008 R2 shared the same internal code base because you could be assured of high interoperability with applications and a similar interface. But given the upcoming changes in both client and server paradigms, it makes sense to differentiate them going forward.
	
	Windows 10 aims to be faster-paced in general, with the new end-user features delivered regularly, although IT organizations can instead align their strategy with the “long-term serviceability branch” and opt for consistency and stability as desired. In contrast, Windows Server 2016 aims to be an even more cloud-optimized system, drawing heavily on technology derived from Microsoft Azure. In particular, the so-called <a title="Windows Serve 2016 Nano Server" href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-server-2016-leaks-reveal-nano-server-protected-vm-role-plans/" target="_blank">Nano Server</a> feature will be one of its cornerstones, with refactored PowerShell CoreCLR as the primary management interface.
	
	A compatibility mode will exist to support the current generation of server roles and applications in the marketplace, such as traditional RDS farms and IIS web services, plus improvements in <a title="Virtualization Solutions" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/virtualization" target="_blank">virtualization </a>and storage. Meanwhile, the micro-services layer will move towards being the future foundation of containerized Docker applications, Windows Fabric and PaaS. In short, this means it won’t always be necessary to run a full VM in order to achieve isolation of enterprise software applications, resulting in reduced overhead and increased ability to scale dynamically.
	
	Management of this new technology will also fall under two comparable umbrellas. When the Windows 10 client OS launches later this year, an updated SCCM will release alongside it. The remainder of the System Center suite, which is more closely tied to the server release cycle, will come out in 2016.

			<title>The End is Near… Are You Prepared for Life After Windows Server 2003 Support Ends?</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[The day of reckoning is almost upon us. On July 14, 2015 Windows Server 2003 support will end. This means that Microsoft will no longer push patches and security updates, and physical and virtualized instances will be vulnerable to security threats. This is a big deal, 37 critical updates were applied in 2013 alone. Furthermore, companies that continue to run Server 2003 will fail standard compliance audits.
	
	In other words, <strong>if you are still running Windows Server 2003, you need to migrate or your business might be headed south.</strong> Fortunately, there are some very good options and the team at SWC is highly skilled at making these Windows Sever 2003 migrations.
	
	Windows 2003’s successor, Windows Server 2012 offers a wealth of improvements including integrated virtualization, enterprise-class scalability, improved security, and much more. It excels in interoperability with cross platform technologies, and given that many businesses have heterogeneous environments, this is critical. It also gives your users secure access to corporate resources on their own devices (<a title="Bring Your Own Device" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/managed-services/byod-polices-mobile-device-management" target="_blank">BYOD</a>), and adds new, powerful end-user capabilities such as SSL virtual private networks and DirectAccess.
	
	Given the number of improvements from Windows Server 2003, Microsoft has said that there is a “substantial learning curve” to move directly from Windows Server 2003 to Windows Server 2012 R2. Thankfully, the SWC migration team has a wealth of experience to this end and can save you time (and headaches) getting there.
	
	Some of you might be considering moving to Windows Server 2008 in the interim. Microsoft highly discourages this approach, as they ended mainstream support in January 2015.
	<h2>What Can the Cloud Offer?</h2>
	The time is ripe to transform your datacenter and take advantage of <a title="Cloud Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">cloud computing</a>.
	
	<strong><em>“According to IDC, 70% of CIOs will embrace a “cloud first” strategy in 2016.”</em></strong>
	
	Businesses are increasingly looking for ways to improve agility and scalability, and with the cloud’s operational model, you only use and pay only for the resources you need. This will save you money on data storage.
	
	Microsoft’s cloud computing platform and infrastructure, Microsoft Azure, is for many, the perfect solution. It’s a powerful tool for both infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (Paas). It lets you provision, deploy, monitor and manage nearly every aspect of your applications and infrastructure. Its hybridization allows you to meld your current on-premises environment with the cloud providing excellent scalability and flexibility for your business.
	
	Think of this as an opportunity. Migrating to a cloud-based service allows you to prepare for the next generation of hybrid cloud computing, not to mention the flexibility, agility and scalability—which alone make the move well worth it.
	
	Before you jump headfirst into the crystal clear waters of Windows Server 2012 R2 and Azure, keep in mind that this migration can be challenging. SWC can work with you to access your current environment and design an on-premises, cloud or hybrid model that best fits your organization’s needs.

			<title>Share Files with your Customers Quickly and Easily</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/share-files-with-customers</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[As documents continue to grow in size and detail, it has become a challenge to share these documents with your customers and vendors. End users are often frustrated that a file is too large for their email and IT staff is amazed at the amount of growth in Exchange databases related to all of these large files. Without a centralized system provided by the organization, many end users turn to DropBox, <a title="Microsoft One Drive" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365/onedrive-for-business">Microsoft OneDrive</a> or other free services to share these documents which opens up the organization to the risk of data loss.
			
			SWC recently investigated options to solve this problem and found two systems that make sharing files with customers quickly and easy: Microsoft OneDrive for Business and Citrix ShareFile.
	
	<h2>Microsoft OneDrive for Business</h2>
	OneDrive is Microsoft’s cloud document storage service. OneDrive for Business takes all of the features of OneDrive for personal use or the old SkyDrive and centralizes it for your organization. With OneDrive for Business you can upload and share all of your documents to an easy to use web interface.
	
	<img class="alignnone wp-image-16548 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/One-Drive-500px.png" alt="One-Drive-500px" width="500" height="270" />
	
	As with all <a title="Microsoft Cloud Solution" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services">Microsoft cloud products</a>, one of the benefits of OneDrive is that it integrates with the Microsoft Live ID system. If you are sending documents to a customer or vendor then you don’t need to create an account for them or setup a username and password. Instead, just share the documents to their email address and they can use their Live ID to access them. If you prefer to send a file that doesn’t require a log in, you can do that as well—making it easy to send files that anyone can see. As an added bonus, if your OneDrive includes Office Web Apps, your customers can view and edit the file directly in their browser instead of having to download it.
	
	OneDrive for Business also allows you to share out a folder so you can receive files form a customer or vendor.
	<h2>Citrix ShareFile</h2>
	Are you looking for more security auditing or an on-premises data storage option? Citrix ShareFile may be the solution for you. Just like with OneDrive for Business, ShareFile allows you to share out documents and folders with your customers and vendors, and it also has a web application component to easily view files in any browser. Unlike OneDrive, ShareFile also includes an option to send an upload link to your customers to easily upload their documents. With an intuitive web interface and file management system, ShareFile is one of the easiest tools we have found for sharing documents.
	
	<img class="alignnone wp-image-16547 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Citrix-500px.png" alt="Citrix-500px" width="500" height="266" />
	
	ShareFile’s added benefit lies in its security features. ShareFile reporting allows you to report on file access by either a specific user or by a specific file/folder, so you can see exactly who accessed the files and when they were accessed. ShareFile also allows you to set user permissions to make sure that access to sensitive information is restricted. If you have sensitive data that you are concerned about storing in the cloud, ShareFile also has connectors that allow you to use its interface but store the data in an on-premises server. This lets you control and store the data locally while maintaining the easy-to-use ShareFile interface for your end users and customers.

			<title>Mobilegeddon Has Arrived. Is Your Website Mobile-Friendly?</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-marketing/mobilegeddon-mobile-friendly-website</link>
			<pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 20:02:20 +0000</pubDate>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[By now you have probably heard of Mobilegeddon, Google’s algorithm update that focuses on the mobile-friendliness of web pages. On February 21, Google posted a blog with this message:
	<blockquote>Starting April 21, we will be expanding our use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal. This change will affect mobile searches in all languages worldwide and will have a significant impact in our search results.</blockquote>
	Thankfully, for <a title="Chicago Search Engine Optimization" href="/solutions/digital-marketing/search-engine-optimization" target="_blank">Search Engine Optimization</a>, Google has made a tool to <a title="Google Mobile Friendly Test" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/" target="_blank">test the mobile-friendliness</a> of your webpage. If you’re not sure where to start with all of this, check out their <a title="Mobile Friendly website" href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/get-started/" target="_blank">mobile-friendly guide</a>.
	
	<h2>The Importance of Mobile Search</h2>
	It makes sense to award mobile-friendly sites with better rankings in mobile search results. <strong>Smartphones and tablets now account for 60 percent of total digital media time spent.</strong> What’s more, from June to November 2014, 48 percent of Google search traffic came from mobile devices.
	
	It also makes sense to penalize or demote those websites that are not mobile-friendly. How many times have you tried to find information on-the-go, only to land on a page where you had to pinch and zoom and scroll horizontally across the page? Odds are you probably left that page quickly and went somewhere else.
	
	It is important to note that Google’s new mobile algorithm will score each page of your site individually, not sitewide. Android apps will also be indexed.
	<h2>What if My Site Isn’t Mobile-Friendly?</h2>
	There are generally two ways to go about <a title="Mobile Friendly Website" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing" target="_blank">making your website mobile-friendly</a>: creating a dedicated mobile site or employing responsive design (responsive designed websites are those that automatically resize to fit any device). One is not necessarily “better” than the other; it depends on a number of factors such as the type of content you need displayed on your mobile site. If you update your content often, for example, it may be more cost-effective to invest in a responsive website where all of your updates can be made in one place.
	
	SWC has been recognized for our mobile-friendly responsive website designs. One of the latest examples of this is the <a title="Responsive Mobile Design" href="http://www.swc.com/swc-technology-partners/news/best-in-class-web-design" target="_blank">IMA Best in Class Design Award</a> for Strive Logistics. For more examples of responsive website designs, <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">contact SWC</a> or attend our next<a title="Digital Marketing Chicago Events" href="http://www.swc.com/events" target="_blank"> Chicagoland Internet Marketing event</a>.
	<h2>A few additional things to keep in mind:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>This algorithm update only affects searches done on mobile devices</li>
		<li>Make sure you are not blocking CSS and javascript, as Googlebot must be allowed to crawl these in order for your page to pass mobile-friendliness test.</li>
		<li>Algorithms run in real-time, so you don’t need to wait long to be properly indexed once your site is mobile-friendly</li>
		<li>Remember, Googlebot ranks on a page-by-page basis. If you have more pressing pages that affect your daily mobile traffic, update those first.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
	<strong>Mobile friendliness is no longer an option - it's a necessity.</strong> Don’t lose valuable mobile visits and potential business. Call 630-572-0240 to review your current website and get a pragmatic, cost-effective pathway to optimizing your website.<h3>Related Blogs</h3>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most popular requests we get asked at our <a title="Microsoft Dynamics Event" href="http://www.swc.com/events" target="_blank">CRM Chicagoland luncheons</a> is to compare <a title="Microsoft Customer Management System" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management" target="_blank">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a> to <a title="Salesforce.com CRM" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm/salesforce-com-customer-relationship-management" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>. Probably not a surprise - a vast majority of the companies we talk to who are looking at a CRM system are selecting between Microsoft and Salesforce, both leaders in the <a title="Best CRM Systems" href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-1XJHQ4X&amp;ct=140716&amp;st=sb" target="_blank">Gartner Magic Quadrant</a> for sales force automation.
			
			The marketing engines of both of these companies are powerful and well-funded. What companies do find is that both Microsoft and Salesforce provide a significant amount of functionality compared to other vendors. It's still rather unusual to see CRM solutions with sales pipeline management, drag and drop dashboarding for management, email marketing, marketing automation and customer service under one umbrella or product line. Most of the competitors are still trying to be great at one thing. Meanwhile, Salesforce and Microsoft are providing the ability for companies to create a 360 degree view of their existing and potential customer base – their sales pipeline.
	<h2>Microsoft vs. Salesforce</h2>
	Let's compare Microsoft to Salesforce. Which one is the best? The answer (shockingly) is that it depends and it’s always changing. That's a major benefit of vendors who provide cloud software solutions, they are constantly being updated. Here is what I tell those who attend SWC’s <a title="Chicago CRM" href="http://www.swc.com/events" target="_blank">CRM events</a>:
	<h3>Microsoft Dynamics CRM Advantages</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Simpler licensing model – most features are included</li>
		<li>Better Outlook and Office integration – better user experience and less configuration for admins</li>
		<li>Great for when you need on-premises CRM</li>
		<li>Newer User Interface</li>
		<li>Small, but growing marketplace</li>
	</ul>
	<em>Consider When:</em>
	<ul>
		<li>You have a Microsoft Enterprise Agreement – CRM licenses can be added creating licensing management efficiencies</li>
		<li>Seamless integration with Outlook is needed</li>
		<li>You’re an Office 365 customer or heavy Microsoft shop</li>
		<li>You’re a Dynamics AX customer</li>
		<li>You need on-premises custom systems integration</li>
		<li>Your budget is tight and you need features such as mobile</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Salesforce Advantages</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Complex pricing model – “a la carte” pricing and monthly fees to use APIs on some licenses</li>
		<li>Market leader in terms of adoption</li>
		<li>User Interface hasn't changed much in years</li>
		<li>Strong marketplace for add-ons</li>
	</ul>
	<em>Consider When:</em>
	<ul>
		<li>You are not a Microsoft shop – you can get aggressive pricing from Salesforce</li>
		<li>Salesforce AppExchange provides a vertical solution that fits your needs</li>
		<li>You need sophisticated Marketing Automation solution</li>
	</ul>

			<title>Extending Your Domain into Microsoft Azure: It’s Not as Scary as You Think</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/extending-domain-microsoft-azure</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[When Microsoft first released their Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas) offering within Azure, one of the most common questions was how to deal with domain controllers. For many organizations, if you can’t extend your domain into Azure then you are limited in what you can do. For many, this was initially a somewhat complicated and scary process.
	
	In the past six months, Microsoft has worked hard at updating Azure Virtual Machines and Azure Networking to make adding a domain controller into Azure safe and practical. Here’s what has changed and what you need to consider before extending your domain into Azure:
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Site-to-Site Tunnels</strong> – As with any secondary location, to extend your on-premises domain into Azure you need to have a tunnel between the two environments. Azure is now fully capable of making tunnels with all major brands of firewalls including Cisco, SonicWALL, Fortinet, Juniper, Palo Alto and many others. For organizations with multiple locations, depending on your firewall device, Azure can also establish a multi-site tunnel allowing all of your remote locations to connect to the same Azure environment.</li>
		<li><strong>Static IP Address</strong> – For any domain controller, one of the main requirements is a Static IP address to ensure that DNS can successfully connect and Active Directory requests will succeed. In previous versions of Azure, there was no option for reserving an IP address to a VM and instead there were various workarounds that risked the IP changing if the machine was shut down. In the newest version of Azure, options have been added to reserve a static IP for any VM. With one quick command your domain controller can now have a dedicated IP that is reserved and will never change, even if the machine is shut down or restarted.</li>
		<li><strong>Active Directory Database Caching</strong> – Like any database, the Active Directory database can be damaged if the server does not shut down cleanly. While this is unlikely in Azure, this was a concern because the operating system drive on all VMs uses caching technology which might not write back all changes to the database in the event of a dirty shutdown. To resolve this concern, Azure now has easy options for adding additional data disks to the domain controller that do not use caching. These drives are fully supported for the Active Directory database and ensure that the risk to the database is minimal in the event of a shutdown.</li>
	</ol>
	But what about Azure Active Directory? We are often asked if Azure AD can be used as a replacement or a supplement for a domain controller. Unfortunately, at this time Azure AD is purely a user database and is not designed for computer accounts or for managing computer logins. If you are interested in putting your domain into Microsoft Azure, your best solution is still to install a domain controller using Azure Virtual Machines.
	
	SWC has experience setting up many domain controllers in Azure and we are always <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">available to help</a> you design your deployment and extend your environment into Azure. Contact us at 630.572.0240 to learn more.<h3>Recommended Posts</h3>

			<title>How Website Security Impacts SEO</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Certainly by now most companies have either heard about or experienced for themselves the devastating setbacks that can take place from both a revenue standpoint and a reputation standpoint when a cyber-security breach occurs. But just in case you didn’t already have enough reason to <a title="Sony Cyber Attack" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/security/sony-hack-malware-protection" target="_blank">not want to become the next Sony</a>, I have one more reason for you – <a title="SEO and Security" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing/search-engine-optimization" target="_blank">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</a>. You’re not the only one who cares if your site is secure, your customers care and therefore Google cares, too.
	
	<em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/05/new-research-ad-injection-economy.html">new research</a> published on <strong>May 6, 2015 </strong>from Google and UC Berkley, 5.5% of unique IP addresses are infected with adware. When you think about the number of websites that exist today, 5.5% accounts for more than 5 million websites. Google's radar for adware issues is heightened by the fact that they have received 100,000 user complaints about them in Chrome since the beginning of 2015. There are more complaints about adware than any other issue... These numbers are staggering and can only suggest that Google has taken a renewed interest in website security. We can expect more information to arise on this topic in the coming months. Stay tuned!</em>
	
	Over the past year, we’ve talked a lot about the importance of user-friendliness for SEO. As technology changes, the expectations of your users change as well. Certain features and functionalities of your website go from being nice things to have to absolute necessities for staying in the good graces of consumers. And with 93% of all online experiences beginning with a search engine, Google has a keen interest in understanding what the users want and serving up the websites that deliver it to them. This became all the more evident on April 21, 2015 when Google announced their new algorithm update which now penalizes websites that are not mobile-friendly – the update has since been coined, “<a title="Google mobile update" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-marketing/mobilegeddon-mobile-friendly-website" target="_blank">Mobilegeddon</a>.” Overnight, mobile-friendly websites went from being nice things to have to being absolutely necessary. <a title="Responsive mobile design" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/seo/search-engine-technology-changing-seo" target="_blank">Don’t say we didn’t warn you</a>!
	
	As we continue to drive better SEO in anticipation of the changes in technology, it’s only natural that we put website security front and center. Hackers are becoming increasingly more capable of installing malicious code, redirecting your website to another, pulling private data such credit card information or removing your website completely. If a consumer lands on your website while it’s down, or worse, has their sensitive information stolen, they not only blame the website itself but also the search engine that served them the harmful link in the first place.
	
	So, what is Google doing to protect their web browsers from harmful sites? They are warning searchers by labeling potentially dangerous websites with the simple line, “This site may harm your computer” below the title of your listing in the search engine results page. Are you at risk for getting tagged with a malware warning? If so, there are steps you can take to prevent this label from happening. Ideally, of course, you’ll want to take these steps before Google identifies your site as being dangerous to consumers.
	
	Taking website security a step further, Google recently updated it’s algorithm this past August by giving a ranking boost, albeit a very weak ranking boost, to those websites that are secure with a HTTPS encryption. If you are an eCommerce website that handles sensitive passwords or credit card information, a HTTPS encryption is especially important to your business. However, with more than 200 ranking signals, regular content websites can get away without one. At least for now.
	
	That being said, just like Google’s “Mobilegeddon,” that we could spot from a mile away, all signs point to security becoming a bigger ranking factor in the coming years for all websites. Google even states that they “may decide to strengthen” the security signals in the future (hint, hint, nudge, nudge). If you have not taken steps to ensure a more secure website, here are some things you should be doing now:
	<ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Stay up-to-date on your webserver software</li>
		<li>Keep your Wordpress plugins up-to-date</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a cloud-connected world, <a title="Security Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/security-services" target="_blank">information security</a> and technical vulnerability are a rapidly evolving landscape. It seems every week there are reports of some new hack or exploit that can afflict small businesses and large corporations alike.
	
	The good news is – you may already have some powerful tools at your disposal to help guard your network, such as the <a title="Microsoft System Center" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-system-center/microsoft-system-center-2012-r2" target="_blank">Microsoft System Center 2012 R2</a> suite. <strong>While System Center won’t remove the need for dedicated security appliances and procedures, it can be used as a versatile toolset to complement your defense arsenal.</strong>
	
	<img class="alignnone wp-image-16722 " src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/SWC-Security-1024x538.png" alt="SWC-Security" width="474" height="249" />
	
	Patching with Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) keeps systems up-to-date and is the first line of defense against known exploits. For instance, when a recently released <a title="Web Security Update" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3002657" target="_blank">Microsoft security update like KB3002657 </a> is announced, WSUS integrated into <a title="System Center Configuration Manager" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-system-center/integrating-microsoft-system-center-configuration-manager-2012-r2" target="_blank">System Center Configuration Manager </a>(SCCM) will report in the console on which machines need it; it can then be scheduled and pushed out as per corporate policy within defined maintenance windows.
	
	Within SCCM, several other mechanisms can be useful for security purposes. Machines can be pre-provisioned with BitLocker, a full disk encryption feature and SCCM can push Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) agents. Baselines and compliance can auto-install corporate mandated software, like Endpoint Protection for antivirus, or trigger uninstalls of unapproved applications. Software inventory and application metering provides an overview of software present in the environment. In case of a vulnerability, such as the recently disclosed <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms14-064.aspx" target="_blank">critical CVE-2014-6332</a>, SCCM can perform file gathering operations to report on things like version information and date/timestamps so administrators can more quickly identify affected systems. Used in conjunction with the <a title="Defense against cyber attacks" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/jj653751" target="_blank">Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit </a>(EMET), remediation can be undertaken.
	
	<a title="System Center Operations Manager" href="/solutions/microsoft-system-center/operations-manager-scom">System Center Operations Manager (SCOM)</a> has a component called Audit Collection Services (ACS), which can collect logs from domain controllers into a database for analysis and reporting; or author a management pack to present a subset of this information directly within the SCOM console. SCOM can be used to coordinate approvals for Change Management when conducting emergency patching, so the process can be reviewed and tracked later. Further customization could be implemented with Orchestrator, such as to pull and parse data from other security systems. If there is need to restore in the event of corruption, call on Data Protection Manager (DPM).
	
	The System Center suite itself aspires to be secure, as many elements utilize computer or web certificates to secure communications between agents and servers when available, for things like IIS and SQL Reporting Services. Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented to provide granular access levels for various tiers of IT support staff in order to grant rights only to those who need it.
	<blockquote>SWC has a knowledgeable staff of IT security professionals that can help take your security infrastructure to the next level with network intrusion detection, perimeter defense mechanisms, audits, penetration testing and security as a managed service.</blockquote>
	As previously stated, System Center won’t remove the need for dedicated security appliances and procedures but can be used to compliment your defense arsenal. So, if you’ve got it, leverage it! And, if you’re thinking about deploying it, <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">ask swc</a> what you can do to maximize your ROI with Microsoft System Center!<h3>Recommended Microsoft System Center Posts</h3>

			<title>Use Veeam Backup Copy to Replace Your Tape Drive</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/veeam-backup-security-solution</link>
			<pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2015 14:04:31 +0000</pubDate>

			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.swc.com/?p=16729</guid>
			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Veeam Backup and Replication is a backup application that SWC has recommended to a number of organizations. For both VMware and <a title="Microsoft Hyper-V" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/virtualization/microsoft-hyper-v" target="_blank">Hyper-V</a> virtual environments, Veeam is designed to perform virtual machine level backups so that organizations can restore anything from an individual file within a server all the way up to the entire virtual machine file as a whole. Veeam also includes tools for <a title="Microsoft Exchange Online" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365/exchange-online" target="_blank">Microsoft Exchange</a>, <a title="Microsoft Sharepoint" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint" target="_blank">SharePoint</a>, Active Directory and SQL which make restoring data to those applications quick and easy.
	
	When using any backup solution, one of the most common questions we get asked is, “How can I get rid of the tape drive?” While Veeam has tape drive support and can be configured to work with a tape system, it also has a feature called Backup Copy which can help make your tape drive no longer necessary.
	
	Veeam Backup Copy is designed to replicate your existing backup files to an alternate location. Once the Veeam software performs your regular nightly backup, Backup Copy can be scheduled to take that backup file and run an incremental backup against it to an alternate location. Since only the changes in the backup are transferred, the copy can often be done in a matter of minutes—even over a WAN connection. The benefit of Backup Copy is that because it is processing the backup files, it does not require any interaction with the virtual machine or the hypervisor, thereby having zero impact on your production systems.
	<h2>Veeam Backup Copy and the Cloud</h2>
	The target for a Veeam Backup Copy can be any Windows server with available storage. Pairing Veeam with a <a title="SWC Cloud Services" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">cloud service </a>such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, or the SWC Cloud allows for easy offsite replication of your backups. Any organization that has multiple locations can also use Veeam Backup Copy to replicate backups between sites for greater redundancy.
	
	Backup Copy can be scheduled with different retention periods and synchronization schedules allowing for a similar experience to tapes but without the hassle of ever having to rotate a tape or remember to take it offsite. Backup Copy files are also archive-ready files that can be stored on external hard drives, or, if small enough, burned to media for long-term retention. These files can then be imported into any Veeam environment—not just the system that created them—for easy recovery in the event of an outage or disaster.
	<h2>WAN Accelerator Optimizes Available Bandwidth</h2>
	If your organization has a large amount of data that is changed in the backups each night, then bandwidth is often a concern. Veeam recognized this concern and created an optional component called the WAN Accelerator to help optimize any available bandwidth.
	
	By default, Veeam compresses the data to reduce the amount transferred before sending it to the target server. The WAN Accelerator takes it one step further and performs deduplication on the data as it is being transferred. In order to ensure backup integrity, the backup files themselves are not deduplicated, but the WAN Accelerator can monitor the traffic that is waiting to be sent across the link and then determine if it already exists at the target WAN Accelerator’s cache. If it does exist, instead of being transferred across the link a second time, the required data is copied from the cache at the target end, allowing for quick local copy and reduced bandwidth requirements.
	
	<strong>Bottom line:</strong> If you are sick of your tape drive and are either already using Veeam or have a virtual environment, then Veeam Backup Copy may be a good solution.
	
	At SWC, we work with a number of cloud vendors, including Veeam, to find the perfect solution to grow your organization. We believe the cloud is for everyone, but not for everything, so you’ll only get the solutions that are right for you. Plus, with our extensive technical background and experience, we know exactly what requirements to consider before moving over your applications and systems.

			<title>QlikView vs. Tableau: Which Business Intelligence Tool is Right for My Organization?</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many companies looking to implement a <a title="Business Intelligence Service" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/business-intelligence" target="_blank">business intelligence solution</a> come to us and ask which product is the best? The answer is – it depends on a variety of factors and what your organization needs the data to do. Two popular visualization products we recommend are <a title="Tableau 8.2 Features" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/ask-swc/new-features-tableau-8-2" target="_blank">Tableau </a> and QlikView. Read my blog to learn more about which product is right for your organization.
	
	<h2>Chicago Area Business Intelligence Solutions 630-572-0240.</h2>
	
	Tableau is a visually rich and highly intuitive drag and drop business intelligence product that people of any skill level can use to analyze data. Tableau gives users the ability to query relational databases, cubes, cloud databases, and spreadsheets and then generate shareable graphs. Tableau also makes it easy to store data from Salesforce, Google Analytics, or any of your databases and then set up automatic refreshes to make sure everyone is working off the same up-to-date data.
	
	Similarly, QlikView also boasts easy drag and drop data analysis and visualization capabilities for the layman. Like Tableau, data from the web, databases, spreadsheets, and other areas can be integrated. Charts, tables, and graphs are wired together, and your insights are easily shareable. QlikView’s responsive interface adapts to any device, and developers can build custom apps and visualizations with open-end APIs.
	
	QlikView and Tableau offer strong dashboard and visualization capabilities. However, fundamental differences exist, making it important for any company to understand its user base, as well as how—and for what purpose—the tool will be used, before deciding which solution is the ‘right’ fit. <strong>So how do they stack up?</strong>

	<h2>Analysis Tools</h2>
	QlikView has been described by its users as a BI solution with a developer’s point of view and may be best suited for a company that understands its data and has concrete questions it hopes to answer. It provides strong flexibility in building a dashboard through its unique approach to data integration which provides faster calculations within the software for interactive queries and reporting. It maintains an easy reporting functionality and a clear structure with extensive filtering options that carry over from sheet to sheet.
	
	Perhaps QlikView’s greatest differentiator is its drilldown capabilities. QlikView is best leveraged by a developer or dashboard author with at least some familiarity with basic VBA programming or Excel forms experience, while consumers of the dashboard require little technical background for adoption.
	
	Tableau, in contrast, is a BI solution with an analyst’s perspective. For a company with a large amount of data available but unclear insight into what challenges it may help solve, Tableau can serve as a powerful data exploration tool that delivers insight in seconds and provides the flexibility to change views—and the question it’s answering—on the fly with just a few clicks. Its range of visualization options is unmatched, allowing its users to view the same set of data in a variety of ways.
	
	Tableau’s greatest differentiator is its intuitive design and UI, making it easy for any user, regardless of technical expertise, to very quickly build instant and real-time dashboards and perform ad-hoc, personalized analysis to inform decision making.
	
	We are big proponents of these two powerful BI tools here at SWC.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the Ignite Conference, Microsoft provided exciting new details about the future of <a title="Microsoft System Center 2012 R2" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-system-center" target="_blank">Microsoft System Center</a> Configuration Manager (SCCM). With the upcoming <a title="Release Date Windows 10" href="http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-windows/downloadable-windows-10" target="_blank">release of Windows 10</a> this summer, enterprises need to be able to support the deployment and management of the new operating system on a diverse ecosystem of devices. SCCM continues to be the standard for on-premises management of those devices.
	<h2>What Is Next for Configuration Manager in 2015?</h2>
	In order to support the deployment and management of Windows 10 with existing SCCM installations, Microsoft plans to release a service pack for Configuration Manager 2012 SP1 and Configuration Manager 2012 R2.
	
	<strong>This service pack includes:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Full support with existing features for Windows 10 deployment and management</li>
		<li>App-V publishing performance improvements</li>
		<li>Increased scalability – Hierarchies can now support 600,000 clients while primary/standalone sites can support 150,000 clients</li>
		<li>Improved Content Distribution – Improvements around content distribution for both slow and high latency networks as well as pull distribution points</li>
		<li>Support SQL 2014 as the database backend</li>
		<li>Support for conditional access policy, mobile application management and Apple Device</li>
		<li>Enrollment Program when integrating SCCM with Microsoft Intune</li>
	</ul>
	In addition to the service pack for existing SCCM installations, the technical preview of the next version of SCCM is available now.
	<h2>SCCM Technical Preview Features and Improvements:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In addition to the typical refresh and replace scenarios for operating system deployment, Windows 10 adds in-place upgrades. The next version of SCCM adds support for an in-place Windows 10 upgrade with OS deployment task sequences</li>
		<li>SCCM installation on Azure Virtual Machines</li>
		<li>SCCM integration with Microsoft Intune allows for the mobile device management of Windows 10 devices without the requirement to store data in the cloud. This is a key feature for managing devices that do not have internet access, such as the "Internet of Things" devices.</li>
	</ul>
	Finally, to support the deployment of Windows 10, an update for the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit is planned that will include support for Windows 10.
	
	Everyone at SWC is excited about the announcements from Microsoft this week. For additional information about the exciting updates to SCCM, subscribe to our blog.
	
	If you would like assistance planning your move to the new version of SCCM or Windows 10, please <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">reach out to SWC</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[When we ask our customers why their <a title="Microsoft Dynamics CRM" href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management/crm-2013" target="_blank">CRM systems</a> are largely unused by their marketing and sales teams, there is usually a long pause that follows. We've found that long pause represents uncertainty about the true reason why the team struggles with getting a CRM system that is used throughout the organization.
	
	A recent study by <a title="CRM Study" href="http://www.merkleinc.com/news-and-events/press-releases/2013/merkle-executive-survey-effective-customer-relationship#.VUjCIvlViko" target="_blank">Merkle Inc</a>. backs up this point. Their study shows that "CRM success" fails due to the following reasons:
	<ol>
		<li>CRM projects are failing the organization</li>
		<li>Lack of ownership of customer insights</li>
		<li>Lack of management availability</li>
		<li>Lack of executive sponsorship</li>
		<li>Not an IT priority</li>
	</ol>
	Let's take these one at a time and talk about how to possibly remedy the issue.
	<h2>1. CRM Projects are Failing the Organization</h2>
	We see CRM projects not live up to the hype primarily because the system is built to solve the wrong problems or they don't solve any big problems. The first time around, companies frequently want to spend the least amount of money and time to implement the system. The initial step of defining what's important to your marketing and sales team is glossed over quickly so that the team can begin configuring the system. It's a step that feels like a waste of time, but it is not. It's actually the most important step! It requires getting decision makers in a room for a few hours a day over the course of a week. That's a big commitment to many people. However, it is well worth it. Our Discovery sessions address this challenge.
	<h2>2. Customer Insights are Lacking</h2>
	CRM systems are built to hold information about your customers. When a CRM system can provide a 360 degree view of your customer base (both potential and existing), you have hit the jackpot. A common issue arises during the early stage of the project where leadership is not in the room to define how the company measures success. This would translate into reports that provide insight into how the business is doing. These reports show up in weekly and monthly meetings as the foundation for decision making. This usage pattern will then trickle down into influencing how your sales and marketing staff manage their customer data in the CRM system.
	
	A common problem is that the project team settles for the native reporting that a CRM system provides. A common mistake is that the project team believes their company can get away with vanilla reports, when in fact, their business model is unique. The solution is to build reports that are used by the leadership team in their weekly and monthly meetings.
	<h2>3 and 4. Lack of Management Availability and Executive Sponsorship</h2>
	I lumped these two together because they are similar. If you've read points 1 and 2, you realize that this point has a major impact on the success of a CRM system. It is easy for somebody to say that a project fails because they don't have management availability and/or executive sponsorship, but 8 out of 10 times this is due to the fact that the project team has not demonstrated value to management and leadership. They don't see CRM as a game changer. It's an IT project.
	
	One scenario that we've found resonates with this group is the concept of Marketing and Sales Alignment. This is where the marketing and sales teams need to develop a business case for building a system that can measure marketing spend as it relates to sales. If a company can measure the value of their marketing spend, leadership will listen. Marketing automation and sales pipeline management systems are built to solve this problem. Some CRM systems do both. We'll be spending more time in a future article on this concept because it deserves more attention.
	<h2>5. Not an IT Priority</h2>
	I put this last in the list for a reason. If you can put a plan in place to address items 1-4, this does not become an issue. It doesn't become an issue because it will no longer be just another IT project that requires funding with no justifiable return on investment (ROI). It's easy to move a project like this to the bottom. By defining the business value of a CRM project, the project will get funded by the business and naturally move up the project list. It will become an IT priority.

			<title>Azure Static vs. Dynamic Routing Gateways – What’s the Difference &amp; Which One Should I Chose?</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[When configuring resources in Microsoft Azure, one of the first decisions you have to make as an organization is how to <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/windows-azure-pack" target="_blank">connect the on-premises environment to Azure</a>. For some organizations ExpressRoute (Azure’s dedicated circuit solution) is the answer, but for many the best choice is to create a site-to-site tunnel using an Azure gateway. In this situation, most people get their networks configured and are ready to create the gateway, when and then you notice that it asks if you want a Static Routing or Dynamic Routing gateway. There is no obvious choice between the two, and in fact the answer to the question can be somewhat complicated. To make it easier, let’s look at the differences between the two gateways:
	<h2>Static Routing Gateway</h2>
	The Static Routing Gateway is the “default” option in that almost any firewall device that can create an IPSec tunnel can connect to a Static Routing Gateway. This is because the following configuration is used for this gateway type:
	<ul>
		<li>A Static Routing Gateway uses IKEv1 for its tunnel connections. This type of tunnel is available on all devices and is the most globally compatible. IKEv2 is also available on many devices but if your firewall does not support it you will need to use a Static Routing Gateway.</li>
		<li>As the name suggests, a Static Routing gateway uses static routing for its connections. What does that mean? It means that both sides of the tunnel have hard coded rules sending specific subnets across the tunnel. This ensures that the traffic for the subnets you specify in your Azure network configuration is transmitted across the tunnel, but if you want to reconfigure your network in the future you have to modify the configuration both in Azure and your firewall. Just as with a firewall you can have static routes or you can use routing protocols (OSPF, RIP, EIGRP, etc.) the Azure Static Routing gateway is the Azure solution for static routes.</li>
	</ul>
	
	So what’s the downside of a Static Routing Gateway? The main consideration is that the static gateway is a single site-to-site connection. For example, if your organization has multiple locations and you would like to create a tunnel from all of your offices back to the same Azure gateway you can’t with a static gateway. Only one tunnel is allowed and all of the other locations will need to route through that primary office first. Static gateways also limit your ability to use point-to-site VPNs and Azure-to-Azure connections which may be of use if you are trying to connect multiple regions or services together.
	<h2>Dynamic Routing Gateway</h2>
	The Dynamic Routing Gateway is the “better” option in that it does not have the limitations of the static routing gateway. In particular, you can have multiple tunnels between on-premises locations and Azure. Dynamic Routing Gateways also support point-to-site VPNs, Azure-to-Azure connections and combinations of the above. However, for a Dynamic Routing Gateway the following configuration is required:
	<ul>
		<li>A Dynamic Routing Gateway uses the IKEv2 protocol for its tunnel connections. As discussed above, not all firewall devices support this tunneling method. If your firewall does not support IKEv2 you will need to contact the vendor to see if it is on their roadmap before you can set up a Dynamic Routing Gateway.</li>
		<li>And so what does dynamic routing mean? In dynamic routing Microsoft is expecting that you will use a routing protocol to communicate subnets across the Azure tunnel instead of sending static routes. This gives greater flexibility in your subnets and makes managing them easier because the routing protocol automatically updates the subnets transmitting across the tunnel, however – again your firewall device needs to support routing protocols across a tunnel.</li>
	</ul>
	So which gateway type do you pick? The answer really comes down to which firewall device you have. Whenever possible, you want to use a Dynamic Routing Gateway, however your firewall must support it. Unfortunately, at the time this blog is being written, many of the most common firewall types – Cisco ASAs, Palo Altos, Sonicwalls and Watchguards to name a few – either do not support IKEv2 or do not support dynamic routing across tunnels and therefore are not compatible with Dynamic Routing gateways. Microsoft maintains a useful list of which devices are and aren’t compatible with which gateway types. That list can be found here: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj156075.aspx" target="_blank">VPN Devices and Azure Gateways</a>

Your free time is often spent trying to meet leadership’s demands to provide quantifiable campaign returns. Often we are drowning in spreadsheets, PowerPoint slides and a desire to implement the next great idea. We realize we need technology to get it all done, but obtaining that technology is a challenge because a) you don’t have the budget or b) you have the budget but are still waiting on IT to get to you in their queue of projects. So how do you work smarter?
	
	If you’re looking for the technology roadmap with the best return on investment insights, there are great <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm">CRM</a>, <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/business-intelligence">marketing and analytics tools</a> geared for mid-size businesses. For those interested in more information on those tools and the pathway we’ve found most successful in this space, as well as some D-I-Y insights, you may wish to consider attending our <a href="http://www.swc.com/events" target="_blank">selling smarter thought leadership series</a>.
	
	The key to implementing any technology, is to first have an awareness of the business development tactics that garner the biggest returns. Here’s some key questions I would first start asking yourself:
	<ul>
		<li>Who are your high-value customers?</li>
		<li>How are you segmenting your customers?</li>
		<li>What defines a qualified lead?</li>
	</ul>
	These questions can help initially funnel your business development strategy. For example, let’s take the first question: Who are your high-value customers? The key term in that question is “high-value.” which can be taken many different ways. Companies may look at their top revenue producers for the year and perhaps even draw some conclusions based upon size and industry as to what makes a “high-value” customer. Do you consider profitability, or the cost to service those accounts? How about the number of referrals that they have provided resulting in future sales? Sales can often provide these anecdotal insights that then begins to drive the sales strategy.
	
	The ideal state is to be able to quantify customer value. Anecdotally it’s the outliers that are often shared as they are the most interesting, but that can bias your corporate decision making process. If you’re not tracking your sales information in a way that can be tied back to demographic data, then start. If you’re not tracking each business development interaction, then start. These are two of the primary factors in the difference between <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/customer-relationship-management/how-to-fix-crm-system" target="_blank">a successful CRM implementation</a> and a failed one.
	
	Now let’s say you have the data and a bit of time – where should you start making sense of all that information? Start with identifying your high-value strategic customers. Then begin to calculate your Customer Lifetime Value (LTV). This process can be a little akin to the infamous chicken and the egg, but that’s okay – the assessment itself can provide a depth of insights that direct your tactics. For example, you may start with a prediction that your high-value customers are those that bring in the top 20% of your annual revenues. You may find that this 20% have some similarities – maybe they are all the same size company, or in the same industry or geo-location. Or maybe they all came in through the same sales person or marketing channel. Interesting right? There are a number of additional elements you need to calculate LTV, which at its most basic level it is:
	<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Average Order Value * Number of ‘Lifetime’ Purchases</strong></p>
	As you review the different insights that go into creating the calculation, you will learn valuable information regarding your target customer. Researching your target customer in turn, will provide valuable insights as to how to best reach them and where to target those business development dollars. But the foundation? The foundation is to start tracking the data.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[SWC was recently selected by Microsoft to host their annual Technology Roadmap Event at their Midwest District Headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana. The event was a huge success and we had a great turnout and engaging audience. Nearly 50 IT leaders joined us to hear Microsoft’s vision around productivity with <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365" target="_blank">Office 365</a>, data insights with <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365/power-bi" target="_blank">Power BI</a>, the <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">Azure Cloud</a> and the <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-windows/downloadable-windows-10" target="_blank">road to Windows 10</a>.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/Microsoft-Technology-Roadmap.pdf" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16985" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/microsoft-technology-roadmap-blog.png" alt="microsoft-technology-roadmap-blog" width="500" height="280" /></a>
	<p style="text-align: center;">For those of you who couldn’t join us, you can download a copy of our <a href="http://www.swc.com/Microsoft-Technology-Roadmap.pdf" target="_blank">Microsoft Indiana Roadmap event slides</a> here.</p>
	
	One of the highlights of the event was hearing from two of our Indiana customers, T2 Systems out of Indianapolis and Ash Brokerage out of Fort Wayne speak about their decision to move to the Microsoft cloud. Here is a recap:
	<h2>T2 Systems Talks Microsoft Office 365</h2>
	Jim Hutchins, CIO and EVP of IT and Grant Dawson, Director of IT at T2 Systems spoke about their decision to move to Microsoft’s Office 365 stack and their experience leveraging <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365/exchange-online" target="_blank">Microsoft Exchange Online</a>, <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint" target="_blank">SharePoint Online</a> and Office 365 Apps. The move to Office 365 solved a business challenge, enabling them to be more flexible for Mergers and Acquisitions and freed up T2 Systems’ core team so that they could be dedicated to their customers rather than their infrastructure. One of the important points brought up by Jim was around user adoption and communication. This was key to get user buy in and champions in each department were designated to ensure successful adoption of the new technology. Jim mentioned that as they move forward with future acquisitions, he will emphasize the importance of user adoption and communication even more (a key differentiator for SWC when it comes to Office 365). When we asked Grant what new technology in Office 365 he will deploy next, Grant responded enthusiastically with <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/unified-communications/skype-business" target="_blank">Skype for Business</a>. Grant feels that Skype for Business will not only enrich productivity for his end users, but will also provide tremendous cost savings by replacing their existing conference, web hosting, IM/presence and voice platforms.
	<h2>Ash Brokerage Talks Microsoft Azure</h2>
	David Threm, CIO at Ash Brokerage spoke about the decision to integrate <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a> into their infrastructure. Ash Brokerage is currently constructing a new office building with plans to move in 2016. Rather than investing in a huge amount of capital for infrastructure such as storage, David has invested in Microsoft Azure to support the transition. Additionally, David brought up that Azure security and Disaster Recovery was something that he couldn’t hire for and he appreciates Microsoft’s emphasis on data security and redundancy. Microsoft Azure has provided David with an environment where his app developers could quickly test and build applications without burden to his already operationally consumed infrastructure team. In the past, this could cause delays to ongoing infrastructure and development projects or create additional infrastructure spend for hardware and licensing for building applications. With Microsoft Azure, David’s developers can quickly build an app on Azure and deploy services to their customers.
	
	Attendees also learned how to mobilize their workforce with Windows 10, increase business productivity with Office 365, make better decisions with their data using <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/business-intelligence" target="_blank">Microsoft business intelligence solutions</a>, and save time and money by extending their infrastructure to the Azure cloud. Thanks to everyone who attended made this event such a success.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm/microsoft-dynamics-customer-relationship-management">Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 and 2015</a> have powerful capabilities for sales, marketing and service automation, landing them a spot as a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for sales force automation and CRM customer engagement. If there was one chink in the armor of Dynamics CRM, it would be the ability to update multiple records at once. If you are a sales professional with dozens of opportunities, you are acutely aware of this issue. One of the most common use cases for sales professionals is to update the Estimated Close Date on opportunities. Instead of opening up each opportunity in a new window, which slows down productivity, the user makes multiple updates at once and saves the changes.
	
	SWC Technology Partners has created an add-on that allows CRM users to update multiple records on one pane of glass or view. The add-on application is called CRM Inline Editor. Here are the features of the CRM Inline Editor:
	<ul>
		<li>Create and/or edit multiple records at once without repeatedly opening new CRM windows</li>
		<li>Can be embedded in a form to quickly add related records to an existing opportunity, account, or any other record type</li>
		<li>Supports all CRM data types, and can be used with either custom or CRM standard record types Screenshots illustrate how a user can quickly add many related records (a custom rent entity) to an opportunity that represents a process for leasing retail property</li>
		<li>When you are done making your changes to the related CRM records, you can click “Save,” or click the “Add New” button to create additional records</li>
	</ul>
	<img class="alignnone wp-image-17016 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/CRM-Inline.png" alt="CRM-Inline" width="500" height="382" />
	The CRM Inline Editor can be used for more than opportunity management. More information about the CRM Inline Editor can be found on Microsoft Pinpoint.

			<title>Secure your Network Access with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the mobile workplace becomes more and more common in the corporate environment, usernames and passwords are often not enough to protect an organization’s network. Just as banks, credit card companies, and sites such as <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365" target="_blank">Office 365</a>, Gmail and Facebook offer a <strong>second level of authentication</strong> via text message or phone call, many organizations are looking to do the same. This provides a higher level of confidence that the person accessing your corporate data is your employee and that any attempts to compromise user passwords will not allow for remote access. If your organization fits into this category, an easy and effective solution is implementing <strong>Azure Multi-Factor Authentication</strong>.
	<h2>How does Azure Multi-Factor Authentication work?</h2>
	Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a cloud-based service that installs a small utility into your network. For supported applications, this utility intercepts the login request and <strong>after verifying the user name and password it requests a second level of authentication from the user.</strong> This authentication can take multiple forms:
	<ol>
		<li>Azure MFA can call the user on a designated phone number. The user simply presses a key to verify that they initiated a login request.</li>
		<li>Azure MFA can send a text message to a user’s phone with a one-time password. The user enters this password into an authentication prompt to confirm their identity.</li>
		<li>Azure MFA also has a mobile app that can be installed on a user’s phone. This app provides multiple methods for verification that can be configured based on the user’s preference and the specific phone and app model.</li>
	</ol>
	Regardless of the authentication method used, once the user verifies their identity, the utility allows the login request to continue and the user is granted access to the company resource. If the secondary verification does not complete; however, the utility responds to the login request with a failure and the connection is dropped, thus protecting your resources.
	<h2>What can be protected using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication?</h2>
	There are many types of resources that can be protected by Azure MFA. Two of the most common are:
	<ol>
		<li>VPN Connections through RADIUS – The Azure MFA utility can be installed on your Windows Server-based RADIUS server and will perform the secondary authentication for all VPN connections. This ensures that any user connecting to your corporate network is verified both via the RADIUS access rules and by the multi-factor authentication. In addition, since Azure MFA integrates with the RADIUS server itself, this solution is firewall agnostic and will work with any existing firewall you might have in place that supports RADIUS.</li>
		<li>Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) – Many organizations use ADFS for active directory application authentication both on-premises and in the cloud. Some examples of these applications are Office 365, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Citrix ShareFile, and Salesforce.com. Azure MFA integrates into the ADFS process to require that second level of authentication when accessing these applications. In addition, ADFS also has advanced options when working with Azure MFA, including only authenticating certain applications, certain users, or only when connecting from outside the corporate network. And just as with RADIUS, because the Azure MFA integrates with ADFS, the solution is application agnostic and can apply to a large range of services.</li>
	</ol>
	Remote Desktop access, IIS based websites and many other systems can also be protected using Azure Multi-Factor authentication.

			<title>Microsoft Ignite 2015 from a SharePoint Perspective</title>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[By pretty much any measure, the May 2015 Microsoft Ignite conference was a big deal. Held at McCormick Place in Chicago, Microsoft combined several of its previously separate IT Pro-focused conferences into one huge event. More than 23,000 people attended, with more than 1,100 breakout sessions and countless hours of great information about Windows 10, Exchange, <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/unified-communications/skype-business">Skype for Business</a>, <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint">SharePoint</a>, Office 365 and more. Over 15,000 people packed into a huge room for the Ignite Keynote, where Satya Nadella and other Microsoft execs laid out their vision for the future.
	<h2>Microsoft Ignite Keynote 2015</h2>
	There were three main points at the core of the keynote, which together define how Microsoft intends to deliver more value in today's rapidly evolving business world:
	<ul>
		<li>Create more personal computing</li>
		<li>Deliver an intelligent cloud back-end</li>
		<li>Reinvent productivity and business processes</li>
	</ul>
	The drill-down on these points highlighted Microsoft's renewed focus on the user experience across all devices, in an almost always connected world, where businesses (and their employees) have different needs and expectations than they did even a couple of years ago. Microsoft continues to accelerate their cloud-first strategy, wherein <strong>new solutions, capabilities and functionality are rolled out to their subscription-based hosted services more quickly than the traditional on-premises product offerings.</strong>
	<h2>The SharePoint Perspective</h2>
	So, what does all that mean to all the people who deploy, administer, manage and use SharePoint? For starters, what I didn’t hear a lot about were details on SharePoint 2016, which is the name for the next major version of SharePoint for on-premises deployments. Microsoft did talk about the “SharePoint Roadmap” in fairly high-level terms, but didn't get very specific. This is understandable, since SharePoint 2016 is more than a year away. But it also means that you can get a lot more insight into the future of SharePoint on-premises by looking at the <a href="http://roadmap.office.com/en-us">Office 365 Roadmap</a>. ”Cloud-first” now truly means that it is <strong>unlikely we'll see any new capabilities in SharePoint 2016 that aren't first deployed in SharePoint Online</strong> (within Office 365).
	
	The other major takeaway for me was that it isn't just about SharePoint anymore. “reinvent productivity and business processes” really means leveraging more of the whole suite of end-user tools that Microsoft provides via Office 365. All of the demonstrations I saw of “next generation portals” focused on OneDrive, Yammer and Office Delve as much as SharePoint.
	
	In particular, Delve and the Office Graph technology behind it, is very exciting. It combines search technology with analytics integration and machine learning to deliver a personal portal that is smart enough to present high-value content targeted to individual users. Here’s what it looks like:
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17063" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Delve.png" alt="Delve" width="400" height="340" />
	
	Perhaps the best part is, through the magic of Office 365, you don't have to do any work to start leveraging Office Delve. It automatically shows up on your Apps menu and it knows how to scour your SharePoint sites, OneDrive folders and other content repositories to find highly relevant content for each individual.
	<h2>What to Expect from Microsoft in 2015 and Beyond</h2>
	Microsoft's promises to create more personal computing, deliver an intelligent cloud backend and reinvent productivity and business processes will directly impact the future of SharePoint and Microsoft's investments in the product. We can expect to see SharePoint Online and the rest of the Office 365 suite evolve more quickly, with new capabilities being subsequently delivered for on-premises deployment scenarios via cumulative updates, service packs and major releases like SharePoint 2016. More than ever, business users will look to IT to provide guidance regarding how to best leverage all the new tools at their disposal. The challenge of balancing between enabling business users to do more on their own while ensuring that they don't end up causing chaos, remains. As always, SWC is here help—feel free to <a href="mailto:jeff.lanham@swc.com">reach out to me directly</a> to discuss how.
	
	Long live SharePoint!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[After being recognized by <a href="http://www.swc.com/swc-technology-partners/news/crains-chicago-business-swc-a-best-place-to-work-2015" target="_blank">Crain’s Chicago Business as A Best Place to Work in 2015</a> for the fourth consecutive year, we decided to hold a weeklong celebration to reward all of our team’s hard work and dedication. <em>SWC Employees – You Rock! Week</em> featured plenty of great food, treats and healthy drinks. On Friday we capped off a week of fun by celebrating with a happy hour party at Weber Grill, where a number of lucky employees took home some big prizes.
	<h2>Day 1: Full Breakfast Bar</h2>
	In true SWC fashion, we decided to start off <em>You Rock! Week </em>with a full breakfast bar! If you speak to anyone who works at SWC, then you know that we have no shortage of food around the office. Whether it’s fresh fruit Tuesdays or catered team meetings, there is always food at the center of our employee interactions. Starting the week with a nice warm breakfast for the entire office was well received by all.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17152 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/crains-1.jpg" alt="crains-1" width="400" height="331" />
	<h2>Day 2: Fruit Smoothie Tiki Bar</h2>
	What’s the only thing better than working at SWC Technology Partners on Tuesday afternoon? Enjoying an ice cold fruit smoothie from a Tiki Bar while working at SWC Technology Partners on a Tuesday afternoon. Employees lined the halls and caught up with colleagues in anticipation of the Tiki Bar. The healthy fruit smoothies were a big hit on a hot Chicago day.
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17153 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/crains-2.jpg" alt="crains-2" width="400" height="331" />
	<h2>Day 3: Gelato from Frost</h2>
	On the third day of our celebration, SWC employees were treated to tasty gelato from Frost. The small flat spoons let you really appreciate how good the gelato tastes. At least a few ice cream to gelato converts were made.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17154 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/crains-3.jpg" alt="crains-3" width="400" height="331" />
	<h2>Day 4: SWC Colors Day</h2>
	Everyone had fun dressing in their favorite SWC colors! Those who did won extra raffle tickets for Friday’s giveaways at Weber Grill. The team enjoyed debating which colleagues’ apparel was truly SWC-colortastic while taking time out to appreciate all of the great people we work with.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17155 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/crains-4.jpg" alt="crains-4" width="400" height="331" />
	<h2>Day 5: Weber Grill</h2>
	After work on Friday afternoon, everyone was invited to celebrate at a happy hour party at Weber Grill. In addition to enjoying great food and drinks, we also gave away some premium prizes including dinner cruises, a hotel stay with spa treatment, cooking classes, gift certificates and even an extra vacation day.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17156 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/crains-5.jpg" alt="crains-5" width="400" height="331" />
	
	After a fun-filled week of eating, drinking, prizes and partying, the team was more than ready for the weekend to start. Happy consultants make happy clients, and we are lucky to have a lot of happy consultants here at SWC Technology Partners.

			<title>What Mobile Device Support Does Your Web Application Need?</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/application-development/mobile-device-web-application</link>
			<pubDate>Mon, 22 Jun 2015 14:02:04 +0000</pubDate>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[The answer is that it depends! As we develop web applications for our clients, part of the design process is to determine what types of mobile devices and optimizations the application needs to support.
	
	Typically the choices include the following options, ranked in order from least to most costly:
	<ol>
		<li>Desktop-only website</li>
		<li>Responsive website</li>
		<li>Mobile website</li>
		<li>Native app</li>
	</ol>
	The goal of this post is to help you understand what each choice means and the pros and cons of each.
	<h2>Desktop-Only Website</h2>
	This is the technology that has been around the longest, and it’s what most people first think of when they imagine their website. If not optimized for mobile, links may be harder to click on a mobile device, the text may be more difficult to read, and content may not display properly.
	<h2>Responsive Website</h2>
	With a responsive website, you leverage the investment already made in your desktop-only website by adding logic that allows this site to adjust itself based on the screen size of the device accessing it. Thus, it “responds” accordingly to the screen real estate.
	
	A responsive website doesn’t scroll horizontally on a mobile device, has text large enough to read without zooming, has plenty of space around buttons and links, and avoids content unplayable on a mobile device. Additionally, Google awards mobile-friendly pages with better rankings in mobile search results. <em>Refer to our blog post on the <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-marketing/mobilegeddon-mobile-friendly-website" target="_blank">impact of mobile friendliness</a> on your search rankings. </em>
	<h2>Mobile Website</h2>
	A mobile website is designed specifically for mobile devices and factors in the limitations of the platform. It is typically an entirely different website built and maintained separately from your main desktop website. For example, if your main web address is www.yourcompany.com, you may also develop touch.yourcompany.com or m.yourcompany.com and redirect to it from your main website when it detects a mobile device.
	
	Mobile websites are optimized for fast loading on limited connection speeds, content is easily accessible through touch interactions and is usually laid out as a single, vertically scrolling column. Horizontal scrolling and pop-ups are bad practices on a mobile website. Furthermore, your mobile website is usually required to be responsive as well, due to the wide range of mobile devices, screen sizes and resolutions that must be supported.
	<h2>Native App</h2>
	A native app is developed specifically for an operating system such as iOS, Android or Windows Phone. Each platform requires a separate build of the software. This approach allows the application to take advantage of the capabilities of the device such as the GPS, camera, local storage or barcode scanning. This provides the user with an experience tailored for their device.
	
	<strong>What Option Makes the Most Sense for You?</strong>
	Is your site mobile friendly? Do you want to take your legacy website and make it responsive? Need a native app built? At SWC, we can help you with any option. There is no single solution that is right for every company. Our team of user experience experts, digital designers and programmers take time to understand the ins and outs of your business so that we can design the perfect custom-tailored solution. Call us today at 630.572.0240 or <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">email us</a> to see how SWC’s multi-practice expertise can help elevate your digital interactions.

			<title>Understanding Your Azure Bill</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently ranked by Gartner as an industry leader due to its ability to help organizations do more, work faster and save money, Microsoft Azure is a great, reasonably priced <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/cloud-services">cloud offering</a>. However, the a la carte service pricing model can add up quickly if you don’t properly manage your Azure implementation. In addition to planning your cloud environment to take advantage of Azure’s sizing and scaling capabilities, it’s also important that you review and monitor your monthly Azure usage and invoice in order to understand where you’re spending your money.
	<h2>The Azure Billing Portal</h2>
	It’s important to review your Azure bill on regular basis so that you have an idea of what usage charges to expect. You are probably already reviewing the PDF version of your Azure invoice and have found that the invoice is an aggregated summary. The lack of details regarding the instance breakdown and the normalization of Cloud Services and Virtual Machine Sizing can make this process confusing. Fortunately, the Azure Billing Portal also provides an option to download the details of your statement as a CSV file. The CSV extract shows the actual usage by instance. Unfortunately, the daily usage section does not contain billing rate information, which can make detail analysis time consuming.
	<h2>Creating a PivotTable Report</h2>
	Your review should be a two-step process. The first step is to view the summary detail in Excel and create a PivotTable report on the name versus the sum of the value (see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ca/article/Quick-start-Create-a-PivotTable-report-0c220f35-e478-49aa-beaf-24018b7f0f64" target="_blank">Microsoft’s Pivot Tutorial</a>). Typically, you’ll find that Azure App Services, Virtual Machines, and Data Services consume most of your budget. Regardless of the actual split, the initial analysis will provide you with a good idea of what parts of your bill you should be concerned about.
	
	<img class=" wp-image-17302 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Azure-Chart.png" alt="Azure-Chart" width="500" height="324" />
	<h2>Looking At What Matters Most</h2>
	The next step is to drill into the details to see if they match your expectations. This can be done by creating a pivot on the “Details” section of the extract. In order to create the pivot and have the data aggregate correctly, you will need to remove the date from the component description. A good starting pivot would be to view “Name and Component” by sum of the consumed units.
	
	One “gotcha” when reviewing the usage of Cloud Services and Virtual Machines instances is that the consumed units are calculated as Single Processor Instances. When reviewing the details, some items to inspect are:
	<ul>
		<li>Review the services and instances that are incurring charges
	<ul>
		<li>Validate that all the services that you are charged for are actually in use</li>
		<li>Keep in mind that many items that are billed by the hour are billed regardless of activity, even if they are turned off</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li>Review the units that you are being billed for
	<ul>
		<li>For items billed by the hour, compare the billed units to the number of hours in the month to determine the average processor instances used in the month. This number can be helpful when reviewing the sizing and scaling of services in your Azure environment.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Actively Manage the Cloud to Save Money</h2>
	Monitoring your Azure spend is an important part of making sure your company's decision to move to the cloud was the right decision. Cloud solutions are only more cost effective then on-premises solutions if they are actively managed. At SWC, we have the expertise to effectively assist you in planning, implementing, and monitoring your cloud solution. <a href="mailto:info@swc.com?subject=Tell%20me%20more%20about%20Microsoft%20Azure">Contact us</a> today and tell us about your cloud or on-premises challenges.

			<title>Using Data to Drive Sales and Marketing Tactics</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/customer-relationship-management/foundation-for-building-data</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a marketing or sales leader, have you ever found yourself sitting in a presentation with beautiful, data-rich dashboards that will help you do leadership things such as review the "state of the union," analyze your progress, make more informed decisions, or predict the future? SWC uses a number of tools such as Qlik, Tableau and Microsoft's recently refreshed cloud-based Power BI solution to create these beautiful works of art through data dashboards that drive the decision-making process.
	
	<img class=" wp-image-17310 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/CRM-11.png" alt="CRM-1" width="500" height="317" />
	
	The challenge we most often see marketing and sales leaders struggle with is where to begin your journey. In our last luncheon, our BI and CRM groups combined forces to talk about the rich and powerful dashboards you can build to help drive your marketing and sales tactics. We used the analogy that the "the pyramids weren’t built in a day." Each pyramid started with one block. In our world, those blocks are your marketing and sales data.
	
	<img class=" size-full wp-image-17311 aligncenter" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/CRM-2.png" alt="CRM-2" width="500" height="317" />
	<h2>Build Your CRM Foundation</h2>
	Companies need a place for their marketing and sales teams to put their campaign, lead, customer, opportunity, and activity data. Most marketing and sales data sits in a CRM system. We use our CRM Maturity Model to help our customers understand where they are in this model. The CRM Maturity Model also helps our customers figure out what the next step is—usually a pragmatic low cost step.
	
	<img class=" size-full wp-image-17312 aligncenter" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/CRM-3.png" alt="CRM-3" width="500" height="317" />
	
	Building the foundation is about getting your data into a system where it can be cleansed and organized so that it can be reported on later. Depending on your level of adoption, you can use our CRM Maturity Model to determine how the data can be further organized and where contextual data can be added to your customer data. Contextual data helps tell a story as it creates relationships between the content and data in your CRM system. This enables you to build more meaningful reports and dashboards.
	<h2>Moving Up in the CRM Maturity Model</h2>
	Sales teams typically at the "Captured" maturity level put their leads, opportunities, activities, and account information into a CRM system. This allows sales managers to use CRM reporting tools to learn more about what their sales professionals are doing. This is basic reporting. It's a great first step. Now let's put contextual data around the information.
	
	Sales teams typically at the "Managed" maturity level implement their sales process in CRM as workflows. These workflows place rules around what data is entered. A great example would be your company's sales stages. This is really the definition of your sales funnel. The CRM workflow requires certain fields of data to be entered before moving on to the next stage in your sales process. Now you have data that describes where you are. Some examples include sales phase, industry, company size, lead source, and email campaign. Reporting on your data becomes more meaningful as the sales manager can now see relationships. These relationships provide information that leads to better decision making. Rich and powerful reports and dashboards can be created at this point.
	
	<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17313" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/CRM-4.png" alt="CRM-4" width="500" height="288" />
	<h2>We’ll Help Establish Your Data Foundation</h2>
	As you progress through the Maturity Model, you’ll start to create visually rich dashboards that drive sales and marketing tactics. But to get there, you need to start with a solid foundation. SWC has the experience and proven methodology to help you demonstrate inexpensive and incremental wins wherever you are in the CRM Maturity Model. Want to start realizing the value of your data? <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">Contact swc</a> today or join us for our next event on <a href="http://www.swc.com/events" target="_blank">using data to drive marketing and sales tactics</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[SWC partners with Simpson Technologies on a variety of projects including <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/managed-services" target="_blank">IT Managed Services</a>. Watch our client success video case study below to learn more about our partnership in action.
	<h2>Simpson Technologies Partners with SWC IT Managed Services</h2>
	<a title="New Features of Tableau 8.2" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/m8vCIikIDJY?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/simpson-case-study-play-big.png" alt="New Features of Tableau 8.2" width="474" height="262" /></a>
	
	Simpson Technologies is a 103-year-old fifth-generation family-owned business specializing in the design and production of advanced process technologies and services for the global metal casting and chemical process industries. Simpson distributes products globally and has offices in Switzerland and India. Because they are running virtually around the clock, Simpson depends on SWC Technology Partners for managed IT services which provides them with the technical expertise and 24/7 coverage needed to efficiently run their business.
	<blockquote>“I can’t imagine doing my job now without SWC. Their professionalism, their expertise, not only on the day-to-day things like support, but also looking into the future at long-term plans. Whether that be going to the cloud or using Office 365.”</blockquote>
	<strong>– Julie McMillin, Chief Information Officer</strong>
	
	As part of the service, SWC’s team worked with the executive team at Simpson to put together a strategic technical roadmap or long-term vision on how the organization could use technology to help enable and grow their business. SWC then helped upgrade Simpson’s current IT environment, putting a strong technical infrastructure in place that they could enhance and expand overtime. SWC’s managed services team now complements Simpson’s internal IT team, enabling them to be more productive and focus on more strategic projects that impact the business.
	<blockquote>“Our internal IT team needs to be functional experts in our business software. In terms of managing our network and designing our website and digital communications. Those are things we can’t have the level of expertise that SWC brings to the table. So it’s great to be able to concentrate our own IT resources on our business processes and have access to all of SWC’s expertise on everything else, and we take advantage of everything else.”</blockquote>
	<strong>– Bruce Dienst, President &amp; COO</strong>
	
	Simpson has embraced technology and knows that it will give them a competitive advantage. It’s fueling a lot of innovation and exciting conversations about where technology can go and help their business continue to grow.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ll be the first to say that traditional/old school <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/business-intelligence" target="_blank">business intelligence</a> does a great job of providing answers to the questions you know you want to ask. What if you don’t know the questions? What if you are more interested in the questions than you are in the answers? Enter Azure Machine Learning!
	
	Azure Machine Learning was launched last summer to much fanfare and marketing hype. Since its inception, features and user adoption continue to increase and we are finding that almost every organization has opportunities lurking that Azure Machine Learning can help to solve.
	<h2>Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Evaluates Azure Machine Learning</h2>
	Recently we had a discussion with Spencer Moore, Director of Information Management at RSNA, regarding the fit for their machine learning needs. After an insightful discussion on requirements and pain points, we elected to take a sample dataset and put it through the paces in a Machine Learning Proof of Concept (POC). In the POC we decided to focus on the following areas:
	<ul>
		<li>The outputs/outcomes should be easily consumed by visualization tools such as Tableau</li>
		<li>Demonstrate ease of data migration from disparate sources to the Azure ecosystem and consumption by Machine Learning experiments/models</li>
		<li>Evaluate text mining capabilities</li>
		<li>Evaluate membership churn capabilities</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Named Entity Recognition</h2>
	One of the datasets we got from RSNA was a large export of emails, customer service comments, and phone conversation debriefs. The dataset was fairly large and most of the text conversations were more than two sentences. This turned out be a perfect dataset for evaluating NER, or <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn905955.aspx" target="_blank">Named Entity Recognition</a>. NER is an actual text mining task in Azure Machine Learning Studio that can interpret a block of text and automatically parse out names, organizations, and places. What’s even more useful is the task does this parsing recursively and can find many entities in single block of text. Imagine, all of these nouns or entities have been parsed from your text data, and you now have the ability to discover some of those unknown questions. For example, “Did you know that Canada is the number one location that CSRs reference in conversation debriefs?”
	<h2>Setting Up the Experiment</h2>
	NER experiments are fairly easy to build. The image below has the following steps:
	<ol>
		<li>We created a data reader that loads the text data from an Azure SQL database. We could have also used a text file, blob storage or an HDInsights Hadoop table as a source.</li>
		<li>We only want to extract named entities from text so in the second step we removed the non-text columns from the incoming dataset.</li>
		<li>The NER task only needs to have an incoming dataset and an output dataset. The output dataset is assumed to be one too many. One incoming record will have zero or many output records because the paragraph text had many recognized persons, places, or organizations.</li>
		<li>The parsed entities are written to a table in Azure SQL where we can analyze the parsed data with adhoc reporting tools (Excel, Power BI, Tableau, etc.)</li>
	</ol>
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17451 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/RSNA-image1.png" alt="RSNA-image" width="500" height="425" />
	<h3>Next Steps</h3>
	Our NER experiment was built to do named entity analysis in a batch process. In the future, we could expose the experiment as a web service and let other applications pipe their datasets into the experiment and get extracted entities as an output. The process of converting an experiment to a web service just requires a few clicks!

			<title>Are Your Passwords A Single Factor Of Failure?</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/security/lastpass-hack-prevention</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I received a wakeup call that I had been needing for a while now. The award-winning online password manager <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/06/hack-of-cloud-based-lastpass-exposes-encrypted-master-passwords/" target="_blank">LastPass was hacked</a> and the password hashes were stolen. For those not familiar with password managers, they use a master password to store all of your passwords in a single secure place that aims to prevent the infamous “Post-It note” password problem. LastPass stores your passwords online so you can access them from anywhere on any device.
	
	The risk users of LastPass are now facing is an attacker cracking their master password and using that password to access all of that user’s credentials for every account they own. This begins to get really scary since users such as myself store passwords to every account they have including banking, investing, server systems, social media and email. This is much the same way your organization may use Active Directory as your single password for all of your services, including those in the cloud.
	<h2>Secure Your Passwords with Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
	So how do we prevent our passwords from being that single factor of failure? We implement and use Two-Factor (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA incorporates an additional physical factor into the authentication process. This second factor is usually something you have such as a cell phone that either generates a code or asks if the person logging into the account is actually you. This means an attacker would need both your username and password and your cell phone. Obviously this makes an attacker’s challenge of breaking into your account significantly harder, if not impossible. Let’s look at this process in action:
	
	When I go to log into my LastPass account it asks me for my username and password.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17460 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Security-11.png" alt="Security-1" width="500" height="299" />
	
	You can see that I only need the username and password to log in and access all of my information. Nothing about this process guarantees that the person logging in is me since an attacker could be using my stolen password.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17455 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/security-2.png" alt="security-2" width="500" height="263" />
	
	Enter the multi-factor authentication solution. This time when I go to log into LastPass I am presented with the same screen, but when I enter my credentials I receive an alert on my cell phone asking if I want to allow the login. I always have my cell phone and I can quickly approve or deny the login request. This puts me in full control and prevents attackers from taking over my account due to a security breach.
	<h2>MFA-Preventable Breaches</h2>
	My specific scenario affected me on a personal level but there are many organizations that have been breached in the past few years due to their lack of MFA. Target Corporation was a high profile example where the lack of MFA led to a massive security breach. Had Target implemented MFA for access into their networks from the outside, they would likely not have been hacked.
	
	JP Morgan Chase is another example where attackers who stole information on 83 million customers earlier this year gained access into the company's network because a server reportedly lacked MFA. I can go on and on naming specific breaches that would have been prevented by multi-factor authentication because it really is a technology that stops attackers in their tracks.
	<h2>Secure Your Organization’s Data On-Premises or in the Cloud with MFA</h2>
	So how can MFA help secure your organization’s data? Multi-factor authentication can be used with most services both on-premises and in the cloud. Some examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Box, Citrix, Dropbox, Facebook, Microsoft Azure, Office 365, Salesforce, SharePoint, Twitter, VPN and WordPress. If an attacker were to steal your password to an MFA-enabled service, they would not be able to access your account or data, thus keeping your information safe.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17456 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Security-3.png" alt="Security-3" width="500" height="194" />
	
	SWC has experience deploying different multi-factor authentication solutions in a variety of scenarios. We can help your organization eliminate the single factor password weakness and dramatically increase your authentication security. We invite you to <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">contact swc</a> about how we can help secure your data with a complimentary security assessment.<h3>Recommended Posts</h3>

			<title>How Fresh Content Drives Rankings and ROI</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Does fresh content really matter? How frequently should a company update website content? Can fresh content actually improve SEO ranking? Content marketing or marketing via the creation of engaging, valuable, and thought-provoking content that drives customer action has been a steadily increasing trend over recent years and with good reason – the results show that content marketing impacts the customer experience.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Content-Marketing.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17557 size-large" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Content-Marketing-467x1024.png" alt="Content Marketing" width="467" height="1024" /></a>
	<h2>How to Incorporate Fresh Content into Your Marketing Strategy</h2>
	In order to effectively market content, there needs to be a place to easily store the content. A company’s website is often the hub and email, social media, and other websites are often the vehicle for promotion. The challenge for most companies is finding time to develop, publish and share the content.
	
	So how do you balance the demand and identify how often you should add fresh content to your website? Here are things to consider:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Ability to Post Content:</strong> If your website requires a developer in order to post content, then it is already getting costly to publish fresh content and there is also likely a delay. If you are in this position, you should strongly consider migrating to a more user-friendly Content Management System (CMS) that allows users to post and alter content with no developer involvement. Most of these solutions can be cost-effective, and some of the best are even free! Though not ideal, an alternative may be to implement a standalone blog which continues to reference your main website.</li>
		<li><strong>Resources to Develop Content:</strong> Those that have a lean marketing or sales team often don’t have the time to generate engaging content. Engaging content is unique and often thought-provoking or entertaining. It incorporates search engine-optimized keywords and calls to action. As a result, many companies lean on other providers to generate great content. In fact, <em><strong>writing and design were found to be the most popular functions that B2B marketers outsourced</strong></em> (according to the <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/B2B_Research_2014_CMI.pdf" target="_blank">B2B Content Marketing: 2014 Benchmarks, Budgets, and Trends—North America report</a>). <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing">Creative Services</a> are value-based and easily affordable to help provide the value without having to hire additional resources in house .</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>The Return on Investment for Fresh Content</h2>
	So we’ve spoken to the cost, but what is the actual value in developing fresh copy and how often should you be updating it? At a minimum, you want your website content to be accurate, so ask yourself:
	<ul>
		<li>Are your current products and/or services accurate on your site?</li>
		<li>Does your messaging reflect your current business and sales strategy?</li>
		<li>Does the site have up-to-date third party testimonials, certifications, etc.?</li>
	</ul>
	Remember that <em><strong>over 78% of U.S. Internet Users Research Products and Services Online before they buy in both B2B and B2C environments</strong> </em>(“Exceptional Social Media and Marketing Statistics for 2014”, Webbiquity, April 2014). They are comparing you to the competition online, and if it does not look like you are the authority, you may lose market share to your competitors.
	
	So why continue to go above and beyond, promoting new content more frequently? Here are some reasons to develop your business case:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Demonstrates your capabilities</strong> – No one wants to read a thesis on everything you can do, but they do want tips. Show that you understand your customer’s challenges by providing insights.</li>
		<li><strong>You need to give to get</strong> – Companies need to market but consumers don’t have a reason to spend their valuable time reading advertisements. If you need to advertise a product, try coupling it with fresh content. You’re planting a seed for the future!</li>
		<li><strong>The fresher the content, the more impressions:</strong> Search engines reward content that is recent or has frequent changes with higher rankings and more impressions.</li>
	</ul>
	Until you have a good infrastructure in place with regards to website technology and resourcing, frequency may have to be limited. Once these mechanisms are in place, you can create great content at a much lower cost, providing a stronger ROI and more lead generation opportunities. Target weekly generation of fresh copy and look to grow your strategy and timing from there.

			<title>Active Directory Synchronization or Federation – Which One Should I Choose?</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/active-directory-synchronization-vs-federation</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last few months, I’ve had many customers looking to move to <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365">Office 365</a> ask what the difference was between Active Directory Synchronization and Active Directory Federation. These customers needed to manage user identities and credentials in the cloud and wanted to know how these alternate solutions stack up in terms capabilities, cost and user experience. Below is a quick overview on the differences between Active Directory Synchronization and Federation.
	<h2>What is Directory Synchronization?</h2>
	Directory Synchronization is the integration of your On-premises Active Directory with an instance of Active Directory running in the Azure cloud. Synchronization essentially makes a copy of the on-premises directory objects and then propagates them to an Active Directory instance in the Azure cloud. After that, synchronization runs on a scheduled basis to push changes from the on-premises directory to the cloud instance. With few exceptions, synchronization only goes from on-premises to the cloud. If one were to create a new user on the Azure Active Directory tenant, that user would live only in the cloud and would never be propagated down to the on-premises directory. This would create a Cloud (only) Identity (see below) which would have its own login credentials and identity for Office 365 applications.
	
	Over the years, there have been several products to effect directory synchronization. FIM, Microsoft's Directory Synchronization (affectionately known as DirSync) and Azure Active Directory Sync Services tools (commonly referred to as AAD Sync). AAD Sync was the replacement for DirSync; however, both tools are being deprecated by Microsoft in favor of Azure Active Directory Connect. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn757582.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank">Learn more about Microsoft's directory synchronization tools</a>.
	
	Since directory synchronization is much simpler to configure than single sign-on (SSO), the benefits of synchronization make it a great choice for many customer scenarios.
	<h2>What is Federation?</h2>
	Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) can be used to provide federation and single sign-on capabilities for end users who want to access Office 365 applications. Windows Server 2012 R2 includes an AD FS role that can function as an identity provider or as a federation provider. An identity provider authenticates users to provide security tokens to applications that trust AD FS (e.g. Office 365 applications). A federation provider consumes tokens from other identity providers and then provides security tokens to applications that trust AD FS.

		<li>SSL certificate from a public CA is required</li>
	</ul>
	</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>
	
	<h2>What is the end user experience?</h2>
	Directory synchronization does not provide SSO because a user that is already logged in on-premises will still have to log in separately to Office 365. However, since the end user will only have to remember one login and password, it will appear very similar (even though in reality there are two different credentials). It will prompt for credentials when, for instance, a user accesses his mailbox in Exchange Online even though he is logged onto a domain-joined client. When the application supports “remembering” or caching the login credentials (such as Outlook), the experience is even more similar because the only time the user is prompted for credentials is on the first connection, after a password change or possibly after a configuration change.
	
	Synchronization should not be seen as a replacement for AD FS, but as an alternative for those that find it sufficient that users have the same password in Office 365 as they do on-premises.

	<h2>How complex is your environment?</h2>
	Many clients find that the added complexity, cost and maintenance effort of AD FS outweigh the almost imperceptible differences between synchronization and federation for straightforward use cases. However, that might change for clients who have more complex use cases requiring multiple identity providers or who have applications hosted in multiple cloud environments. The good news is that you can start with synchronization and then federation can be added as requirements dictate.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[The next version of Lync Server 2013, rebranded Skype for Business 2015, was launched last month, and along with the new name comes a new set of features:
	<h2>In Place Upgrade from Lync 2013</h2>
	If you are running Lync 2013 and are at the latest patch level, you can upgrade to Skype for Business Server 2015 by going through a small series of steps and performing an in-place upgrade. Since the hardware requirements are the same as Lync 2013, an in-place upgrade makes sense and is the recommended upgrade scenario by Microsoft. If you are running Lync Server 2010 you can still upgrade to Skype for Business Server 2015, but the upgrade is a more traditional side-by-side path.
	<h2>New Server Role, the Video Interoperability Server (VIS)</h2>
	Many companies have invested in video-conferencing or telepresence systems, and now you can integrate those systems into Skype for Business for a more immersive video experience. The VIS role enables interoperability with certain approved video conferencing room systems (so far only specific Cisco Tandberg systems that support H.264) and enables a richer experience without extra investment. Oh and did I mention this new server role is free?

	In addition to being able to federate with Skype users regardless of using a Microsoft account or Skype ID, now you can search for contacts directly from your Skype for Business client. In order to gain that federation functionality, your implementation will need to be provisioned via Microsoft’s PIC or Public IM Connectivity portal, which enables the federation from Microsoft’s datacenters to your SIP domains.
	<h2>Call Quality Dashboard</h2>
	The Monitoring Reports from Lync 2013 get a brand new look and make troubleshooting call quality issues a lot easier. A new “role,” or more like a series of web-based reports that leverage the monitoring database, give you a nice dashboard that can show subnets, users, locations, conferences and other groupings that are trending with potential quality issues. Here is a sample:
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17546 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/uc-1.png" alt="uc-1" width="500" height="259" />
	<h2>SILK Codec for Peer-to-Peer calls</h2>
	More a client-side feature than a server-side feature, your peer-to-peer calls between Lync 2013 (latest update) and/or Skype for Business clients will use the SILK protocol, which was originally developed by Skype and later acquired by Microsoft. SILK is built to work around quality issues inherent to home Internet connections, such as jitter, latency and packet loss. This means clearer calls that can withstand worse network conditions than RTAudio was able to.
	<h2>SQL AlwaysOn Support</h2>
	Skype for Business Server 2015 adds support for both SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups and Failover Cluster instances, in addition to the previously supported SQL Mirroring and SQL Clustering from Lync 2013.
	
	There are many other features that come with both the new Skype for Business Server 2015 and Skype for Business client. For further details you can visit the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn933785.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft TechNet article</a>.

			<title>Windows 10 Is Coming!</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[The launch of Windows 10 is just around the corner (July 29th for the first phased rollout) and there is a lot of buzz being generated about Microsoft’s latest operating system. Rightfully so, Windows 10 brings many new improvements focused around productivity, mobility, and security – all while maintaining the familiar user experience your employees love.
	
	With more and more applications and services moving into the cloud, it's important to have an operating system designed with mobility in mind. Furthermore, as mobile device adoption takes off, it is vital to provide a consistent experience for users from device to device. Windows 10 brings this and more.
	<h2>Consistent User Experience Across Devices</h2>
	Windows 10 is the first Microsoft operating system that runs on the full spectrum of device types – from desktop PCs and laptops, to tablets, smartphones and Xbox. It will even help to power the Internet of Things (IoT) by running on many special-purpose embedded devices such as sensors and robotics components.
	
	With Continuum, Windows 10 brings a consistent, yet flexible, user experience across devices. When working on your tablet it provides a touch-friendly full-screen user interface that is easy to operate without a keyboard. If it detects the attachment of a keyboard it can seamless transition out of tablet mode to provide a more traditional desktop experience. It is even possible to use a mobile phone as you would a computer by attaching an external display, keyboard, and mouse!
	
	<a href=" /Microsoft-Technology-Roadmap.pdf" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16983" src=" /uploads/technology-roadmap-download.png" alt="technology-roadmap-download" width="400" height="237" /></a>
	<h2>Manage and Empower End User Productivity</h2>
	The Windows Store brings new ways to connect employees with the applications and tools necessary to perform their jobs efficiently and effectively. All of your company’s line-of-business and other supporting applications can be presented through the Store, providing a familiar self-service model to application deployment. Rather than bothering IT to install the FTP client they need for a new project, they can simply go out and get it themselves. This is of course all under your control; there’s no need to worry about having to true-up 5,000 MS Project licenses when Gantt charts become all the rage.
	<h2>No More Complicated VPNs</h2>
	As we put more data and services into the cloud it is becoming increasingly important to protect that data with robust security controls. Two-factor (or multi-factor) authentication is one of the most effective ways to achieve this level of security without adversely affecting employee productivity. Windows 10 enhances this by making the device itself the second factor. Now, users can gain access to all of their resources from approved Windows 10 devices simply by connecting and typing in a PIN. Your security posture is greatly improved and the end-user experience is vastly simplified without having to resort to complicated VPN solutions or overly complex passwords that invariably end up on a sticky note somewhere.
	<h2>Security for Your Biggest Vulnerability</h2>
	Since we know the human element is often the weakest link in the security chain, it’s necessary to protect well-meaning employees from themselves. Windows 10 includes data loss prevention features that keep company data restricted to approved devices and network locations. Simple rules can be set up to prevent any data from leaving the control of your IT organization, or more granular rules can be created to identify and protect sensitive data based on complex criteria.
	
	It’s already obvious that Windows 10 is the next-generation operating system that will drive production for a mobile workforce, but it’s not always obvious how to get from where you are to where you want to be. SWC has the tools and experience to help guide you along the way. We can help you to build a strategic roadmap and find answers to important questions like:
	<ul>
		<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Preparedness</strong> </span>– Is my environment ready for Windows 10? Are all of our applications compatible and if not, what is our remediation strategy?</li>
		<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Deployment</strong> </span>– How do I get Windows 10 onto all of the workstations and laptops I support? What do we do with older devices and how do we make sure everyone’s data survives the transition?</li>
		<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mobility</strong></span> – What if my employees want to use iPads and other mobile devices? How can Windows 10 help bridge the BYOD gap while providing a consistent experience for everybody?</li>
		<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Training</strong></span> – How do we teach our employees to adapt to Windows 10 without sacrificing productivity?</li>
	</ul>
	Let’s talk Windows 10. Give us a call at 630.572.0240 or <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">shoot us an email</a> and tell us about your business and plans for deploying Microsoft’s next generation OS.
	<h3>You’re Invited to our Windows 10 Release Party Luncheon</h3>
	We’re teaming up with Microsoft to celebrate the release of their most anticipated OS to date: Windows 10! Be one of the first to experience the new and mobile workplace productivity capabilities of Windows 10 and Office 365. Join your local Microsoft reps and Microsoft Gold Partner SWC Technology Partners, as they discuss how the newest wave of Microsoft’s cloud, data and productivity solutions will help your organization succeed. We’ll have a number of premium giveaways and devices on hand so you can experience Windows 10 and how it will transform the way your organization gets work done.

			<title>Migrating Data into Dynamics CRM</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most Customer Relationship Management (CRM) projects we are a part of includes some amount of data migration from the legacy systems being replaced. Typically, the migration needs to be orchestrated in a fashion that it is testable and repeatable. At SWC, we use several techniques to achieve optimal data migration. Each has its place, and there are pros and cons to each approach.
	
	<table>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
	<td>Approach</td>
	<td>Pro</td>
	<td>Con</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Import from flat files using data import features native to CRM</td>
	<td>Easy to use</td>
	<td>Limited capabilities</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Use Scribe software or another third party</td>
	<td>Easy to use</td>
	<td>Third party licensing costs and setup costs</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Use a SSIS package that utilizes CRM web services such as a data destination</td>
	<td>Orchestration, automation, and exception
	processing capability</td>
	<td>Setup costs</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Use a custom developed .Net application that uses CRM SDK</td>
	<td>Ultimately flexible</td>
	<td>Expensive to create and maintain</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>
	
	<h2>The Data-Driven, Systems Integration Case for CRM</h2>
	More and more organizations are realizing the value of adopting a CRM system, or if they already have one in place, using SWC’s proven methodologies to step up a level in the CRM Maturity Model, our blueprint for evaluating where your are in the customer relationship management lifecycle. In doing so, SWC is helping organizations realize the value of their hidden data, particularly their sales and marketing data.
	
	<a href=" /uploads/CRM-Download.pdf"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16522 size-medium" src=" /uploads/CRM-BLOG-GUIDE-300x178.png" alt="CRM-BLOG-GUIDE" width="300" height="178" /></a>
	
	Instead of pouring through mountains of data across spreadsheets and systems, CRM systems like Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Salesforce aggregate and centralize your data to provide you with rich, visual dashboards. Sales, customer service, and marketing processes are made simpler, and with automation tools you can build detailed customer profiles to more accurately qualify your customers and create targeted messages to move them through the sales funnel.
	
	Another reason why organizations are utilizing CRM systems, and one that SWC has helped a number of customers with, is for the automatic integration capabilities with other systems like fulfillment or accounting systems. For instance, an organization can create orders in an ERP system and have those flow into CRM that track sales efforts and see revenue-related data.
	<h2>Moving From On-Premises into CRM Online</h2>
	For many reasons, more and more of our customers are moving away from on-premises solutions and moving into SaaS cloud-based models. CRM solutions are no exception. Lately, we have been helping out on a few CRM on-premises to CRM Online migrations. Microsoft doesn’t provide an easy way to bring your data into your new online tenant, so SWC has created a fast, flexible solution that can pull entity data from one CRM organization and load it into another.
	
	If you are looking to move your on-premises Dynamics CRM environment to a cost saving online cloud-based solution, SWC can help you get there. Contact us now to discuss your data challenges.<h3>Recommended Posts</h3>

			<title>What Is It Like to Have an Inside Sales Job at SWC?</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/careers/inside-sales-job-at-swc</link>
			<pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2015 14:51:38 +0000</pubDate>
			<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jill]]></dc:creator>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.swc.com/?p=17605</guid>
			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Inside Sales team plays a key role within SWC Technology Partners. Our sales reps reach out to prospective clients to better understand their specific business challenges and help them find technology solutions that solve those challenges. I spoke with two members of SWC’s Inside Sales team to learn what makes them successful.
	
	Elaine Green started with the Inside Sales team in 2009 as an intern. That internship converted into a permanent role with the team and she is now the team lead. Eric Jandacek joined the team in 2013 and is one of our top salespeople.
	<h2>Why did you join the Inside Sales team?</h2>
	<img class="alignleft wp-image-17610 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/elaine-blog.png" alt="elaine-blog" width="120" height="120" />
	
	Elaine: As an intern, I already knew I loved the culture at SWC and wanted to grow with the company, so the Inside Sales role was a great place to start. Inside sales reps research and contact organizations to offer SWC’s services. But it’s not a typical sales role. Our sales team is more consultative-minded and seek to understand an organization’s business challenges. They have a deep overall knowledge of SWC’s offerings. It’s a lot of cold calling, but it’s made easier by the fact that SWC has such a great reputation and existing client list when making those initial connections. We’re not pushing a product; we’re offering a deeper level of partnership that you don’t often see.

	Eric: I knew I wanted to get into technology sales after college. I liked talking to people and building those relationships. I liked solving problems. And I knew that technology was a growing industry that was only going to get bigger. This was a great opportunity to get my foot in the door with a really reputable company and learn a lot.
	<h2>What are some of the great things about our Inside Sales role?</h2>

	Elaine: One is that you will learn a ton. You’ll get to work with a variety of technologies and business verticals. We don’t silo off technical areas. You will get a well-rounded background in both software development and digital marketing as well as managed services and infrastructure engineering. I didn’t have a technology background when I started, but now I feel like I have a really strong understanding of the industry as a whole. I don’t know if I could have gotten that anywhere else.

	Eric: The earning potential is great. Unlike a lot of places which operate on mainly a commission structure, we’re compensated with a competitive base salary. Total earning potential with the role is uncapped with additional commission. I don’t feel micromanaged. Ultimately, I’m responsible for how successful I will be, which I like a lot.
	<h2>What are some of the challenges of the role?</h2>
	<img class="alignleft wp-image-17608 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/eric-blog.png" alt="eric-blog" width="120" height="120" />
	
	Eric: Sales isn’t for everyone. You have to be self-motivated and organized. It can be very rewarding, but also frustrating at times, but that’s the nature of the business. If you are persistent, have a positive attitude and set your sights on the big picture, you can be very successful here.
	
	<img class="alignleft wp-image-17610 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/elaine-blog.png" alt="elaine-blog" width="120" height="120" />
	
	Elaine: There is always someone willing to talk to you if you need advice. We really have great mentors here. The people are probably what I love best about working at SWC, they want you to do well. If you are ambitious and not afraid of hard work, this is definitely a place where you can succeed.

			<title>Protect Your DMZ Networks in the Cloud with Azure Network Security Groups</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/dmz-network-protection</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[In most organizations, the on-premises network is segregated into both a local network and one or more DMZ networks. These DMZ networks are used to segregate off systems and are often required for compliance and security purposes. However, for most cloud services—usually by default—all subnets within a private network have full access to all others, so the question becomes <strong>how to create these DMZ networks to ensure the proper level of security.</strong>
	
	<strong>In Microsoft Azure, the answer is Network Security Groups (NSGs).</strong> Network Security Groups are a full access control list-(ACL) based solution that can be applied at the virtual machine or at the subnet level. These groups replace the native Virtual Machine (VM) endpoint functionality and allow for extremely granular management of access to your devices for both inbound and outbound network traffic. These ACLs can be configured by IP address or subnet and then further by protocol and port to ensure that the exact level of access has been granted to the system(s). By default, Network Security Groups also include tags for the Internet and for the Virtual Network to make assigning permissions easier.
	
	For example, <strong>if your organization has a server in Azure that contains sensitive information </strong> such as credit card data or social security numbers, <strong>you may want to limit inbound access to this server</strong> only via a specific port for the database, and only from certain source servers. On the reverse, you may also want to block outbound internet access from this server so that anyone accessing the server can’t connect to other sites and upload data. All of these changes can be specified via a Network Security Group. As an added feature, when applying a Network Security Group at the VM level, the usual firewall limitations of access to devices in the same subnet always being allowed do not apply. Even if a server is in the same IP range as this resource, it will be blocked unless specifically allowed by the NSG.
	
	When applying Network Security Groups there are a few things to consider. First, currently, <strong>the only way to setup a Network Security Group is via Powershell</strong>. Also, once a Network Security Group is applied the usual Endpoint functionality in the Azure web console will no longer be applicable and any changes made via that site will be ignored. However, since these groups can be applied on a VM or subnet basis it is possible to have a mixed environment with most systems using the standard Endpoint functionality and only DMZ-based systems using NSGs. Finally, just like any access control list-based security, it is possible to fully block all access to a device if an NSG is implemented incorrectly, and so care must be taken when designing the ACLs.
	
	At SWC, we have the experience to help design out your DMZ environment in Azure and implement the Network Security Groups to make this possible. Interested in adding this security to your environment? Contact SWC and tell us about your business requirements.

			<title>Can Your Business Afford Downtime or Data Loss?</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Mitigate downtime and restore data with disaster recovery and high availability systems.</em>
	
	Most businesses today run 24/7 and can’t afford server, appliance or system downtime. Having a disaster recovery or high availability system is necessary to mitigate the risk and impact to a business during such a time. Since these two terms are often confused, let’s first define them.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>High availability: </strong>A secondary server, appliance or system is in place that can immediately take over if a primary system becomes unavailable (with little to no downtime).</li>
		<li><strong>Disaster Recovery (DR): </strong>A system or process to restore a server or system in the event of an unexpected event. There is downtime experienced and the process to restore service typically requires a human decision to initiate.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Let’s Start with Disaster Recovery</h2>
	I typically encourage clients to start with disaster recovery. The ability to restore data or recover services should be foundational to any IT organization. Today, most organizations cannot afford to be without priority one applications for more than an hour.
	
	The good news is there are many options that can simplify the implementation of a Disaster Recovery plan and keep costs reasonably low while remaining flexible in the levels of expectations around recovery time.
	
	<strong>If your organization already has a Disaster Recovery plan, it’s importantly to periodically address these questions:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>When was the last time it was reviewed?
	<ul>
		<li>Is the Disaster Recovery plan’s server inventory accurate?</li>
		<li>Are system dependencies clearly defined?</li>
		<li>Is the plan updated when new servers are provisioned?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li>Has it been reviewed by other business units and agreed upon that it meets the business’s needs?</li>
		<li>How rigorous has testing been?
	<ul>
		<li>Are business units included in testing and determining a test’s success?</li>
		<li>How often are tests being performed?</li>
		<li>Are the Disaster Recovery testing procedures well documented?</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<strong>If your organization doesn’t have a Disaster Recovery plan, you need to ask:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Is the business in agreement that no formal Disaster Recovery plan is needed?</li>
		<li>Has a business impact analysis been performed to help determine what the impact of downtime is?</li>
		<li>What is the current level of certainty the business can recover from a disaster?</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Implementing a Disaster Recovery Plan</h2>
	Your Disaster Recovery plan will be successful when you treat it as an ever-changing necessity that is part of day-to-day process. For example, part of the server provisioning process should address the Disaster Recovery updates needed. Here are some steps to help you get started:
	<ol>
		<li>Focus initial efforts on clearly defining the business requirements, not the tools. Select a tool that addresses the business requirements; going the other direction can cause complications down the road.</li>
		<li>Determine who will be responsible to test all services during a Disaster Recovery incident. This needs to include application owners and process owners.</li>
		<li>Instead of looking at Disaster Recovery using a “server by server” approach, map out the services IT is responsible to deliver and which servers are needed within each service. This approach can help move the conversations along with the other stakeholders and simplify discussions on recovery time objective, recovery point objective, etc.</li>
		<li>Discuss the priority of servers, services and applications. During the first iteration of a Disaster Recovery planning project, most organizations I’ve worked with will classify nearly all of the services as “priority one.” While they are all important, when putting a formal Disaster Recovery plan together, it’s critical to specify which servers and services take priority.</li>
	</ol>
	There are several options available for organizations to get a Disaster Recovery strategy in place, including cloud-based options that do not require a capital investment in additional hardware.
	<h2>Do You Need High Availability?</h2>
	Even though Disaster Recovery is often confused with high availability, highly available systems tend to be completely different conversations than Disaster Recovery. There are many factors to consider when leveraging highly available systems including: additional licensing requirements, more sophisticated systems management/maintenance procedures, available data center capacity, etc. You should also consider:
	<ul>
		<li>Utilizing virtualization for their native high availability features is a start, but going deeper into enterprise application’s native availability features (like Exchange DAG, SQL AlwaysOn Availability Groups, file replication, etc.) is a critical component of high system availability.</li>
		<li>Not all applications will require or support high availability configurations. Clearly document which applications should be highly available, highly recoverable, or both.</li>
		<li>IT should get input from other business units to determine what level of protection is truly necessary to the business. For example, active/active configurations may have different cost structures than active/passive.</li>
	</ul>
	The above factors are just some of the considerations to be addressed during Disaster Recovery or availability conversations. SWC can help your organization with service delivery strategy – Disaster Recovery or Business Continuity planning as well as system high availability architecture design, implementation, and performing functional testing to ensure service recoverability.

			<title>Windows 10: Windows as a Service</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft/windows-10-as-a-service</link>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the release of <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft/windows-10-release" target="_blank">Windows 10 fast approaching</a>, clients are asking about Windows as a Service. This new concept can be confusing when compared to Microsoft’s traditional update model.
	<h2>What is Windows as a Service?</h2>
	Windows as a Service is about bringing new and enhanced Windows features to the consumer faster, while allowing enterprises to update at their own pace. Windows 10 has been rumored to be the last version of Windows. Therefore, instead of big product releases, Windows will receive continual security and feature updates much like Office 365 or Gmail.
	
	Patch Tuesday will still exist and security updates will continue to be delivered. Also, Microsoft has no plans to charge for this service, just as it has not charged for the Windows Update service.
	<h2>Why has the feature update process changed?</h2>
	Microsoft recognizes that users want transparency when it comes to new features; they want to be part of the development process and for their feedback to be heard. Consumers no longer want to wait the typical three years between OS releases to take advantage of the latest technology. On the other hand, enterprises want stability, predictability, and flexibility. Enterprises have mission critical systems with long support lifecycles where new features may not be needed. These differences have led Microsoft to reevaluate how features are introduced into the market. Now, as features are developed, they will be released as branches of the OS.
	<h2>How will Microsoft bring new features to the consumer?</h2>
	A branch will be started under the Windows Insider Program. This is where users can test the latest features and provide direct feedback to Microsoft using the feedback app. Once finalized, it will be released to Windows Update as the Current Branch (CB).
	<h2>How will Microsoft bring new features to businesses?</h2>
	After four months of validation through Windows Update, the branch will be available in the new Windows Update for Business as a Current Branch for Business (CBB) service. Businesses using this service will have up to eight months to validate and deploy the CBB. To ensure compliance, Microsoft will be making security updates dependent on branches. Business have the flexibility to have different systems running different branches. Branches can even be skipped since they are cumulative.
	<h2>How will mission critical systems and long support life cycles be handled?</h2>
	A special Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) will be available for enterprises that want the latest security updates (much like a service pack) but don’t want to impact their mission critical systems with new features. Microsoft is committed to supporting each Long Term Servicing Branch for 10 years. The Long Term Servicing Branch will require Windows Server Update Service and Windows Enterprise edition.
	<h2>What about my existing deployment tools?</h2>
	Microsoft has stated that all existing update deployment tools, such as Windows Server Update Service and System Center Configuration Manager, will continue to work as expected. See how System Center Configuration Manager helps you <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-system-center/windows-10-user-management" target="_blank">manage your users</a>.
	<h3>A Summary of Windows Branches</h3>
	
	<table>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
	<td>B<strong>ranch</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><strong>Insider Branch</strong></td>
	<td>Several million members of the Windows Insider program will be the first to receive the latest and greatest features Microsoft has to offer. These users will be allowed to test and provider direct feedback to Microsoft.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><strong>Current Branch (CB)</strong></td>
	<td>Windows Update is used by hundreds of millions of users. As features are made generally available, users of Windows Update will be automatically opted into these new features.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><strong>Current Branch for Business (CBB)</strong></td>
	<td>This branch will be distributed through Microsoft's new Windows Update for Business (WUB). Microsoft will promote a current branch after four months and allow business eight months to prepare for broad deployment. Requires Windows Pro or Enterprise.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td><strong>Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB)</strong></td>
	<td>Distributed through WSUS, this branch will contain security updates only. While security updates will continue to be deployed as they are released, this branch can be thought of as Microsoft's traditional service pack model. Requires Windows Enterprise.</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	It’s exciting to see Microsoft bringing users closer to the development process and at the same time bringing new features to market faster.

			<title>Customer Data Confidentiality in Microsoft Office 365</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/data-confidentiality-microsoft-office-365</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[As more organizations consider moving some (or all) of their information technology out of their own datacenters or “closets” into Microsoft's cloud services – Office 365 and Azure, there are a host of considerations that need to be addressed. From a functional perspective, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and the rest of the back-end products in the Office 365 suite are continually improving, and many of the technical caveats have been addressed. Microsoft is truly making good on their “cloud first” promise, and for some time now, enhancements to Exchange, SharePoint, and other suite products are being rolled out to Office 365 Online before they are even made available for on-premises deployments.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/Microsoft-Technology-Roadmap.pdf" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-16983" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/technology-roadmap-download.png" alt="technology-roadmap-download" width="400" height="237" /></a>
	<h2>The Last Frontier</h2>
	For many types of organizations, the legal, compliance, security, and confidentiality issues are the “last frontier.” Even if you believe that Microsoft's cloud offering has the functional and technical capabilities to meet your needs, you still have to trust that Microsoft will keep your data safe, secure and confidential, not just hackers and terrorists, but also from the government and even Microsoft itself. To its credit, Microsoft has been doing a better job of opening up about key aspects of its Office 365 solutions, and the <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-trust-center-cloud-computing-security" target="_blank">Office 365 Trust Center</a> is a great resource for understanding how your data will be protected. In most cases, <strong>your ‘company jewels’ will be safer and more secure in the Microsoft cloud than they would be on your own internal servers,</strong> and that is good enough for many types of organizations.
	
	But what about scenarios where you need <em>absolute assurance</em> that no unauthorized parties (including Microsoft support engineers) will have access to your most sensitive data? Law firms are a good example: confidential documents and correspondence are subject to “attorney-client privilege,” and disclosure to anyone (including Microsoft support engineers) constitutes a “breach of privilege” that can have significant negative consequences for both client and attorney. Does Office 365 provide the level of confidentiality required to support such scenarios?
	<h2>New Tools for Managing Sensitive Data</h2>
	The answer is: almost, but not quite yet. While your customer data is encrypted in Office 365, and there is a robust lockbox process in place that ensures no one at Microsoft has open access to your data, you still can't be entirely sure when or why it's being accessed. The good news is that <strong>new capabilities are coming to Office 365 that will ensure fully-compliant privacy and confidentiality of your sensitive data.</strong> Microsoft recently announced <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/04/21/announcing-customer-lockbox-for-office-365/" target="_blank">Customer Lockbox</a>, which will provide customers with the ability to explicitly approve or reject any request for access to their data, whether for support purposes or whatever. Additionally, the <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/04/21/enhancing-transparency-and-control-for-office-365-customers/" target="_blank">Enhancing transparency and control for Office 365 customers</a> blog article indicates that, in 2016, Microsoft expects to enable customers to generate and control their own keys for encrypting content in Office 365. Finally, the <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2015/04/21/announcing-the-new-office-365-management-activity-api-for-security-and-compliance-monitoring/" target="_blank">new Office 365 Management Activity API</a> will enable custom reports and push notifications for customer data access events.
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	Microsoft is clearly taking the need to provide maximum security, confidentiality and transparency for its customers' sensitive data in Office 365 seriously. If you have previously written off Office 365 due to privacy concerns, it might be time to reconsider. As always, SWC stands ready to help you evaluate Office 365 (and many other potential options), so you can make the best decisions about what's right for your business, now and in the future.

			<title>Benefits of Using WordPress Content Management System (CMS)</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-marketing/wordpress-content-management-system</link>
			<pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2015 15:32:44 +0000</pubDate>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[In today’s fast-paced world, a good CMS has transitioned from being a nice thing to have to an absolute necessity. If you aren’t familiar with what a CMS can do, here is the quick definition: <em>Content Management System (CMS) is a software that allows you to create, update and publish content and multimedia on your website or blog without extensive coding knowledge.</em>
	<h2>Why a CMS is Necessary</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C<strong>ontent is King:</strong></span> A CMS allows you the capability to quickly <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-marketing/fresh-content-seo" target="_blank">produce fresh content to drive rankings and ROI</a></li>
		<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Time is Money:</strong></span> Third party turnaround can take days, or even weeks. This won’t cut it when your competition is able to make the same changes in mere seconds.</li>
		<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Control is Key:</strong></span> What happens when you have a custom website built by a programmer… who then decides to not work for you anymore? Most developers today know their way around WordPress, but very few would easily be able to come in and decipher the unique complexity of a custom built website designed by a single individual.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Why WordPress is the Right Choice</h2>
	There are several CMS platforms available, but WordPress is far and away the best option for your content marketing efforts. People often make the mistake of classifying WordPress as a simple blogging tool. While this was once true, WordPress has evolved into a fully-functioning content management system <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">responsible for more than 24% of all websites, that is a content management system market share of 60.4%</a>! The website you’re on right now uses WordPress, as well as millions of the most prominent brands in the world, including The New Yorker, Ford, Sony Music, Google Ventures, eBay and many more.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17745" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/WordPress-CMS.jpg" alt="WordPress-CMS" width="550" height="354" />
	
	So why do so many companies rely on WordPress to power their digital assets and content marketing efforts? Let’s explore some of the many advantages of WordPress.
	
	<strong>User-Friendliness</strong>
	One of the biggest advantages of WordPress is its user-friendliness. If you have the basic skills to edit a Word document, you already have what it takes to edit and create webpages in WordPress.
	
	<strong>Open-Source</strong>
	WordPress allows anyone to access its blueprints, manipulate and redistribute it to the masses. Developers create templates and custom features in the form of plugins, many of which are free.
	
	<strong>Cost-Effective</strong>
	Since WordPress is an open source CMS platform, there are no licensing costs. You are free to download templates and add-ons already created by developers and use them in any way you like. To get a more exclusive feel, hiring a third party <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing" target="_blank">internet marketing agency</a> to provide unique design elements, branding and SEO expertise is recommended. Nonetheless, the cost of these customizations become significantly reduced when the basic framework is already in place.
	
	<strong>Security</strong>
	With all this free access, there is a popular misconception that WordPress is not secure. The truth is, security threats are everywhere. WordPress is the most widely used CMS in the world, so naturally security breaches happen – as they do with non-WordPress sites as well. The differentiating factor between a secure site and a non-secure site are the people involved in developing and maintaining it.
	
	<strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Friendly </strong>
	Just by choosing WordPress, you’re automatically taking care of around 80% to 90% of the mechanics of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). In other words, the construction of WordPress’ code is engineered in a way that search engines find very inviting for indexing. But don’t take my word for it, this statement comes straight from <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2009/05/30/matt-cutts-google-sf09/" target="_blank">Google</a>. You can’t just “set it and forget it” though. To fully realize the benefits of a SEO-optimized website, hiring an <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing/search-engine-optimization" target="_blank">SEO agency</a> for ongoing keyword, competition and traffic analysis is highly recommended.
	
	<strong>Control</strong>
	You may want to think twice before working with a digital agency that builds your website on a custom-built CMS. Should you ever decide to take a different direction, or worse, come to find out your agency isn’t delivering what they promised, it won’t be easy to part ways. Why? Because your website is trapped inside their technology! The only way to get it back is in the form of a confusing mess of site files, forcing you to essentially rebuild your website from scratch.
	<h2>WordPress and Content Marketing for the Future</h2>
	WordPress offers so much more than a quick and easy way to get a site up and running. This blogging-based software has revolutionized the way websites are constructed. The speed at which content can now be produced, altered and shared with the masses has forever changed the expectations of consumers and created several new avenues to reach your target market. Whether you’re launching a new business or you’re considering revamping your existing website, selecting a CMS is a vital first step in taking your marketing efforts to the next level.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are now fully immersed in the information age. Organizations large and small are swimming (and some sinking) in data! When I started my <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/business-intelligence">business intelligence</a> (BI) career, the data was mostly trapped in systems and retrieving that data was a fairly straightforward task. Today, new and interesting data challenges crop up out of all kinds of unexpected places.
	
	Though not a new idea, the rise of the “Internet of Things” or IoT is an emerging challenge for analytics. But is there value in IoT data?
	<h2>Early IoT Beginnings</h2>
	Way back in the early ‘90s I got my first exposure to IoT (when it wasn’t called IoT). I was in college at North Dakota State University in Fargo, ND and my father was growing his electrical contracting business into some new markets. One of those new markets was potato warehouse storage systems. These warehouses were typically very large and situated in the middle of nowhere out in the Red River Valley of ND. It was not practical to have human resources manually monitoring these systems, so automation was absolutely necessary.
	
	To guarantee a quality product and ensure that spuds harvested in September could be stored until June required a fair amount of instrumentation and technology. In particular, these warehouse systems needed to monitor and regulate temperature, humidity, and airflow. Enter the precursor to IoT. At the time I really didn’t grasp how important and pervasive this type of technology would become. I can still remember my dad checking on his systems with his laptop and 9600 baud modem, running reports on temperature and humidity and marking remote adjustments to ensure storage conditions.

	<h2>Why I Should Care About the Internet of Things?</h2>
	IoT data is large, in many cases extremely redundant, and often unstructured in its root form. But there is value there, and organizations committed to <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/business-intelligence/qlikview-vs-tableau" target="_blank">analytics and business intelligence</a> should be taking note, or at the very least, taking stock of what is out there. Most organizations don’t have unlimited IT budgets to see if there is value in the latest BI trend. Decision makers need to be pragmatic about IoT data. When my clients ask about IoT, I always suggest that they start with these discovery topics:
	<ul>
		<li>Catalog your sources</li>
		<li>What data do you have, can you have and should you have from candidate IoT sources?</li>
		<li>Assuming that this data can be accessed, stored and possibly transformed, will there be any business value to this data.</li>
		<li>What decisions and levers can I pull with access to this data?</li>
		<li>Could my business use this <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/business-intelligence/master-data-management-solve-data-quality" target="_blank">data to make tactical predictions</a> for the future?</li>
		<li>Which sources have the highest value? Aim for the low hanging fruit first.</li>
		<li>What is my cost to develop these sources into useable information that can drive my business? Some sources will incur more cost for data preparation and cleansing.</li>
	</ul>
	It’s important to have definitive answers to these questions when embarking on an IoT project or any new data source that you want integrated with your analytics systems—whether it be an enterprise data warehouse, data lake, data mart or database.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Is your organization asking the following data compliance and data management questions?
	<ul>
		<li>Is there a more efficient method of managing compliance across my tenant?</li>
		<li>How can I give non-admins access to perform compliance activities without providing them admin rights?</li>
		<li>Can I search through all data in my tenant without setting up an eDiscovery site and cases?</li>
		<li>Can I easily view all users with archiving enabled, or can I bulk enable\disable archiving without PowerShell?</li>
		<li>What if I do not want to <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/microsoft-mobile-device-management" target="_blank">wipe <em>all</em> the data</a> from my users’ personal mobile devices?</li>
		<li>My organization has been subpoenaed to provide mailbox data. Do I really need to configure and setup sites in SharePoint for eDiscovery?</li>
		<li>I require mobile device management, but the Exchange Online mobile device policy doesn’t cut it, and I do not want to purchase Intune or other 3rd party solutions. Are there any other built-in options?</li>
		<li>I have tons of mail data in a third party archiving solution or PSTs dispersed throughout my organization. How can I get this data into Office 365 securely?</li>
		<li>I want to migrate entire file shares, maybe even an entire file server into <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/cloud-based-sharepoint" target="_blank">SharePoint Online</a>. Is there a relatively easy and secure method available?</li>
	</ul>
	If so, Microsoft Office 365 Compliance Center has your answers.
	
	Microsoft understands organizations require comprehensive features to manage and secure the data imported and created in Office 365. With that said, let’s take a look at why, in my opinion, it is <strong>one of the most important updates and features added to Office 365</strong>.
	<h2>Compliance Tasks Have Never Been Easier</h2>
	The Office 365 Compliance Center consolidates the core compliance-related features administrators use to manage and secure their tenant data across Office 365, Exchange Online, and SharePoint Online. You may recognize some functions in this new management portal. Microsoft has moved and will continue to move features into this console from their respective services; for example, archiving and retention from Exchange Online.
	
	The new center makes the sometimes dreaded compliance tasks easier to access and manage. Global admins in Office 365 can access the compliance center through the Office 365 Admin portal, the link is located under the Admin heading in the navigation page. It is also accessible via a dedicated link: <a href="https://compliance.protection.outlook.com/" target="_blank">https://compliance.protection.outlook.com</a>, which can be accessed by your non-technical workers without having to grant administrative rights to your entire tenant.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17844 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/o365-comp-center-image-1.jpg" alt="o365-comp-center-image-1" width="500" height="187" />
	<h2>Permissions in the Office 365 Compliance Center</h2>
	One of the key components which makes access to and management of the Compliance Center an almost enjoyable experience is the <strong>inclusion of the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions</strong> model. RBAC allows you to grant task-specific permissions to users. These permissions will allow the user to access the compliance center directly and perform only their assigned administrative responsibilities.
	
	It is important to note that the RBAC permissions in the Compliance Center are specific only to this console, and membership does not carry over to other Office 365 services. Also, some of the Compliance Center features require additional permissions to be assigned in the respective service. For example, to manage Retention, a user must also be added to the Compliance or Records RBAC group in Exchange Online. As always, <strong>you want to assign the least amount of privileges required for a user to perform their administrative tasks</strong>. Below is a table listing the different administrative roles, their inherited roles, and a description to help you determine where to add your compliance officers.
	
	<table>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
	<td>RBAC Group</td>
	<td>Roles</td>
	<td>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>ComplianceAdministrator</td>
	<td>
	<ul>
		<li>Organization Configuration</li>
		<li>View-Only Audit Logs</li>
		<li>View-Only Recipients</li>
	</ul>

	</ul>
	</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>
	
	<h2>What Can I Accomplish in the Office 365 Compliance Center?</h2>
	Not sold yet on the new Compliance Center just by the easier management of permissions and access? Let’s walk through some of the readily available and most used features in the console; I’m sure there’ll be a few items that will make you a fan.
	<h2>Archiving</h2>
	Mail archiving is a service that has been available since Exchange 2010 SP2, so it’s not a new feature by any means. However, the management tasks available in the Compliance Center make managing the service a super simple administrative task.
	<ul>
		<li>Easily view which users have mail archiving enabled or disabled</li>
		<li>Enable or disable archiving one user at a time or in bulk</li>
		<li>Quick view of a user’s mailbox usage stats</li>
	</ul>
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17845 size-full" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/o365-comp-center-image-2.jpg" alt="o365-comp-center-image-2" width="500" height="234" />
	<h2>Device Management</h2>
	Unlike Archiving, this feature is not another management tool for similar services already available in Exchange Online; mobile device access rules and mobile device mailbox policies. In actuality, the mobile device management policies will take precedence and override any mobile device policies currently configured through Exchange Online in your tenant—something to keep in mind before deploying to your users. The features available through this service leverage Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Azure Active Directory, and are available at no added cost to all commercial Office 365 plans.
	
	Below is a limited comparison list of mobile device controls available in Office 365 via <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/microsoft-mobile-device-management" target="_blank">mobile device management </a>and Exchange Online:
	
	<table>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
	<td>Feature</td>
	<td>Mobile Device Management (MDM)</td>
	<td>Exchange Online</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Restrict access to email</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Require the use of a password on device</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Require encryption on device</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Exclude users from access restrictions</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Perform remote wipe</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

	<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Restrict jailbroken devices</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Managed email profiles</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Advanced system, application, and device settings</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Perform selective wipe</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">Yes</td>
	<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
	</table>
	
	<h2>eDiscovery</h2>
	eDiscovery is another service which is already well incorporated into Microsoft services; in Office 365 eDiscovery can be used to search and place data in mailboxes, SharePoint Online sites, and <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/share-files-with-customers" target="_blank">OneDrive for Business</a> locations on hold. These searches or cases can be used to preserve data indefinitely and also export it from your tenant when required for legal reasons.
	
	In the not so distant past, in order to allow your non-admin compliance officers or HR team access to eDiscovery, you were required to manually create an eDiscovery Center in SharePoint Online. This site had to be configured correctly with the necessary permissions and connectivity to Exchange Online. Not anymore; the first time an administrator accesses the eDiscovery feature through the Compliance Center, the eDiscovery Center is automatically created and configured for you. Your only next step is to assign users to the eDiscoveryManager RBAC group to allow access.
	<h2>Retention</h2>
	The retention Compliance Center feature gives administrators granular control to the life cycle of data in their tenant. Through this feature, administrators can create and manage retention tags and retention polices for mailboxes, as well as document deletion policies for SharePoint Online and <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/share-files-with-customers" target="_blank">OneDrive for Business</a>. These policies are located in the Deletion section as they determine how long data should be present in your tenant before being acted upon.
	
	There is also a Preserve section available in the Retention feature; preservation polices allow you to keep data across your tenant for a specified amount of time (think query-based in-place holds).
	<h2>Import</h2>
	This is one of the newer features to come to the Compliance Center and it is a highly welcomed addition for administrators or IT consultants, especially individuals carrying out the actual migrations to Office 365. Import allows administrators to do just that—import mail data from PST files to Exchange Online mailboxes, as well as import files from network shares or on-premises SharePoint libraries into SharePoint Online.
	
	The data can be uploaded directly to Office 365 over your network, or it can be transferred onto hard drives and shipped to Microsoft data centers. You no longer have to deal with third party data ingestion tools, or worse yet, manually copying data using Outlook or a File Explorer session which constantly times out.
	
	Some of the key aspects of the Import service are:
	<ul>
		<li>Import PST mail data directly to specified users</li>
		<li>Import mail data to a user’s primary mailbox or archive mailbox</li>
		<li>Importing PSTs into a user’s archive mailbox allowing for an unlimited amount of data</li>
		<li>Files can be imported from network file shares or on-premises SharePoint libraries</li>
		<li>Share permissions can be maintained when importing files to SharePoint Online</li>
		<li>Network uploads are performed using command line tools, the Microsoft Azure AZCopy Tool and the SharePoint Online Management Shell</li>
		<li>Network uploads can be secured by using HTTPS</li>
		<li>All drives shipped to Microsoft must be prepared with the Microsoft Azure Import/Export Tool</li>
		<li>Drive shipping accepts only the common 3.5 inch SATA II/III drives</li>
		<li>Drives require the common NTFS formatting</li>
		<li>Only drives up to 4TB are supported</li>
		<li>All drives shipped to Microsoft must be encrypted using the provided BitLocker encryption keys</li>
		<li>BitLocker encryption keys are uploaded directly through the Compliance Center and not available to anyone</li>
		<li>If an extra layer of encryption is required, O365Protect can be used to encrypt data</li>
		<li>Destination of data is specified via “PST to user” and “file to location” CSV mapping files</li>
		<li>Data is temporarily ingested and stored in a secure and unique Azure storage space</li>
		<li>Azure Storage Explorer can be used to view the contents of your tenants dedicated storage location</li>
		<li><strong>As of this writing, this service is free for all valid Office 365 tenants</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Ok, I’m Sold. Now What?</h2>
	As you can see, the Office 365 Compliance Center is making the managing of compliance in your tenant easier, more efficient and transparent. And this is just the beginning; like everything else in Office 365, compliance feature development is moving at a feverish pace and we must keep up if we are to keep our organizations compliant. If you would like to further discuss how compliance can be better utilized and deployed in your tenant, or if you have further questions on any of the items covered here, let our team of Office 365 experts at SWC Technology Partners assist you. <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">Email us</a> or call us at 630.572.0240 today.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Managing patches for vulnerabilities is quickly becoming a full time job for companies. In response to attackers’ willingness to pay to leverage new vulnerabilities to infect your systems, a thriving exploit broker scene has emerged. This has fueled the explosion of zero-day exploits as well as subsequent patches that are released by vendors such as Microsoft and Adobe. The result is a full on race to patch your systems before attackers exploit any vulnerabilities. The time to exploit systems is getting shorter and shorter—to the point where it is no longer feasible to test patches, notify users and finally push the fix to all of your systems.
	<h2>Zero-day Protection</h2>
	So what are we left to do if we can’t patch fast enough? This is where true zero-day or signatureless protection comes in. Traditional antivirus (A/V) uses signatures that are created once a sample of a piece of malware is found. If there is no signature for the malicious software then your A/V will allow the application to execute. This poses an obvious problem if the A/V vendor cannot access a sample and write a corresponding signature fast enough. Zero-day protection does not rely on such signatures, instead it looks at how the malware behaves and makes a determination if it should be allowed to run. This model does not rely on acquiring a sample, having a signature or even knowing about a vulnerability. Rather, <strong>it’s protection by default</strong>.
	<h2>SWC’s Malware Protection Plan</h2>
	SWC has developed a zero-day protection plan to mitigate vulnerabilities and provide companies time to test patches and deploy at their own pace. <strong>Companies will never win the patch race against attackers</strong>; it’s simply too daunting to patch your entire environment every time a 3rd party or critical Microsoft patch is released.
	
	Our approach consists of network border protection with appliances such as FireEye, Palo Alto or Fortinet sandboxing appliances. The latter two can also serve as functional Next-Gen firewalls with AD integration to gain better visibility into the network. To keep with the defense in depth (DiD) principle, endpoint signatureless zero-day protection such as Malwarebytes Endpoint Enterprise (Anti-Malware and Anti-Exploit), as well as application whitelisting (i.e. Bit9) is also recommended. Together, these products wrap signatureless zero-day protection around your endpoints and servers, which <strong>buys you the time you need to test and deploy patches in a consistent and safe fashion without racing the attackers.</strong>
	<h2>Train Your Users to Identify Possible Attacks</h2>
	When attackers do launch their attacks, they commonly start with a <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/security/email-phishing" target="_blank">phishing email</a> that attempts to trick a user into clicking a malicious link or opening an exploit-rigged file. <strong>It’s very important to train users how to identify and deal with phishing emails.</strong> Assess how likely your users are to click on malicious emails and then tailor a security awareness program to address your risks. <strong>SWC has a robust phishing assessment program </strong>that can pinpoint users that are susceptible to phishing attacks and then train them on how to spot a phish before it’s too late.

			<title>IT Leaders Are Excited About Windows 10 Features</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft/windows-10-features</link>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Windows 10 was recently unveiled to the world on July 29th with much fanfare and expectation. That was validated when SWC’s Windows 10 release luncheons at The Gage on Michigan Avenue in Downtown Chicago and Maggiano’s Little Italy in Oak Brook attracted at-capacity crowds of IT leaders. According to local Microsoft representatives, the event at Maggiano’s with over 150 total attendees was one of the largest Windows 10 events hosted in Chicagoland.
	
	At these events, SWC, Microsoft and partners demoed how the new operating system is familiar, secure, productive, and flexible. Here are some highlights:
	<h2>Virtual Desktop</h2>
	Not to be confused with <strong>desktop virtualization</strong>, which is where you run a virtual operating system instance separate from your physical computer, a <strong>virtual desktop</strong> is a way of extending your workspace beyond what is shown on the screen at that moment. Windows 10 virtual desktops allow you to have multiple workspace windows running, each with its own programs. For instance, you might have separate work or personal virtual desktops. You can easily toggle between them—just click the “Task View” button in the bottom left of the Taskbar or press the Windows key + Tab. You can also move programs between virtual desktops.

	<h2>Continuum</h2>
	Continuum allows everyone to have the best Windows 10 experience as they move from device to device while adapting to the way the device is being used. For instance, if you are using a Surface Pro 3 and detach the keyboard, Windows 10 will ask you if you want to enter Tablet Mode. It will then switch over to a larger, more touch-friendly design.
	<h2>Start Menu</h2>
	The Windows 10 Start Menu will attract fans of Windows 7 and Windows 8 alike. Similar to Windows 7, the Windows 10 Start Menu features shortcuts and the ability to search and scroll through all of your applications. It also includes live tiles that you can add, resize, and rearrange. You can further customize the Start Menu by adjusting the size, color, shortcuts, and by grouping applications.

	<h2>Security</h2>
	Security was top of mind for attendees, and the majority of their questions and feedback centered on Window's 10 security. IT administrators will be happy with the ease of use of built-in features like two-factor authentication, data loss protection (DLP), and VPN. DLP distinguishes between personal and corporate data while encrypting data as it arrives on your device from corporate locations. In addition, Windows 10 has features to prevent security attacks and malware that allow IT administrators to determine which apps are trustworthy, and if necessary, lockdown devices and apps that haven’t been signed using a Microsoft-provided signing service.
	<h2>Cortana</h2>
	Cortana is your personal digital assistant. Click the microphone icon and ask Cortana to find a file, set up a meeting, compose an email, tell you a joke and much more.

	<em>Photo courtesy of Microsoft</em>
	<h2>Microsoft Edge</h2>
	Microsoft’s new Edge browser allows you to take notes or highlight information directly on webpages to save and share. There is also a Reading View that removes the distractions from a webpage to allow you to focus in on the article. Cortana is built into Microsoft Edge and can reveal instant answers to your queries without even having to explore search engine results.
	
	<img class="alignnone wp-image-17902" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Microsoft-edge.png" alt="Microsoft-edge" width="500" height="373" />
	<em>Photo courtesy of Microsoft</em>
	<h2>Internet of Things and Business Intelligence</h2>
	Chad Dotzenrod, Director of Business Intelligence for SWC, showed how the <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/business-intelligence/iot-today-are-you-ready" target="_blank">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> and Power BI already exist in lots of daily tech like mall kiosks, automobiles, and security systems. He demonstrated how simply typing a query like, “Which territory had the most sales in 2013” instantly returned the answer in the form of rich visuals like graphs and charts. He also used Power BI to tap into Twitter conversations and display real-time sentiment on a particular topic.
	
	We’re very excited where Microsoft is taking BI and eagerly awaiting Q4 when Cortana is integrated into the Power BI stack.
	<h2>Windows 10</h2>
	Many organizations are already making plans to upgrade to the powerfully productive and secure Windows 10 OS, so if you’d like to take your workplace to the next level, give us a call at 630.572.0240 or <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">send us an email</a> and tell us about your business requirements.

			<title>The Evolution of SharePoint</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/customization-evolution</link>
			<pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2015 17:02:00 +0000</pubDate>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a SWC SharePoint Principal Consultant since 2008, I’ve experienced the evolution of the product. At SWC, we’ve helped many customers <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-sharepoint/swc-sharepoint-way" target="_blank">customize their SharePoint environments</a> — from the basic “I want to make SharePoint not look like SharePoint” to adding out-of-the-box functionality.
	<h2>SharePoint 2007 Introduces API</h2>
	SharePoint 2007 simplified these customizations for developers. In this version, Microsoft created an official application programming interface (API) for SharePoint. It allowed developers to package their customizations into features that could easily be turned on or off by end users. It also introduced an easier way to brand SharePoint by utilizing Master Pages for a consistent look and feel. Master Pages allow SharePoint to maintain a consistent header and top/left navigation area. That was good news for us since branding was the first thing we wanted to change in SharePoint 2007.
	
	Another improvement in SharePoint 2007 was the introduction of web parts. A web part is essentially a single configurable/reusable component or widget that can be used across many sites and site collections.
	
	The most important improvement was the unification of the backend components. This meant that all SharePoint customizations had to utilize the .NET framework. This made perfect sense since SharePoint and .NET are both Microsoft products. The only downside was that this meant no customizations could be written in other programming languages—even older Microsoft languages like VB and ASP.
	<h2>SharePoint 2013 Introduces App Model</h2>
	SharePoint introduced the now familiar “App Model” concept. This is a re-imagined concept for how customizations are created and utilized within both <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/sharepoint/cloud-based-sharepoint" target="_blank">on-premises and Office 365 instances of SharePoint</a>.
	
	In SharePoint 2013, <strong>users can purchase and install pre-approved third party customizations and tools to use on their instance of SharePoint.</strong> Companies can even go as far as customizing what apps are available to users within their own instance of the app store.
	
	At its core, the App Model changes how customizations are written, deployed and managed within SharePoint. Currently there are two types of apps that are supported by the App Model:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>SharePoint Hosted Apps:</strong> <a href="https://store.office.com/appshome.aspx?productgroup=SharePoint" target="_blank">SharePoint apps</a> are hosted within the SharePoint infrastructure, and they are generally geared towards SharePoint components. These apps will typically only use client side API’s such as JSOM (JavaScript Object Model) or REST.</li>
		<li><strong>Provider Hosted Apps:</strong> These apps are always externally hosted and will contain at least one remote component. This component can be anything from a service to a database to store data/information. What makes these apps so flexible is their ability to be hosted on any web technology stack—even apache and Linux servers.</li>
	</ul>
	As with any new technology or framework, there are good things about the new App Model, and there are not-so-good things.
	
	<strong>The Good:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>The App Model now makes it possible for developers to create their customizations in any language,</strong> not just .NET. It allows developers to host their applications on external systems while still providing access to SharePoint. This is a huge advantage simply because developers can now use the language or technology stack they are most comfortable in, and it allows developers to select the appropriate hosting options that best meets their needs; all developers have to do is learn is the SharePoint API.</li>
		<li>With the use of the app store, SharePoint allows for third party companies to distribute their tools and customizations globally.</li>
		<li>Since customizations for SharePoint no longer require you to deploy full trusted libraries to the Global Assembly Cache (GAC), SharePoint environments are now more secure and stable.</li>
	</ul>
	<strong>The Not-So-Good:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>With the introduction of the new App Model, and with more and more companies moving to the cloud, any customization that has been done to SharePoint before the 2013 release will have to be re-designed and implemented in the new App Model methodology.</li>
		<li>Many of the customizations and freedoms we took for granted in our code now become a bit more challenging and require extra effort to develop.</li>
	</ul>

	All in all, I believe the new App Model is a move in the right direction, especially if SharePoint wants to keep up with the push toward the cloud. By adopting the app store concept that has been successfully employed by other big organizations like Google and Apple, Microsoft is opening the doors for great ideas to be developed for the community without the need to wait for Microsoft to provide those features. Some might consider the App Model to have too many limitations; however, the increased security and stability that it introduces makes it a big step in the right direction.
	
	Whether you are new to SharePoint or need to increase user adoption, SWC will work with you to make sure your SharePoint site is a go-to hub for content management and collaboration. Attend our next <a href="http://www.swc.com/sharepoint-luncheon-2-website" target="_blank">complimentary SharePoint luncheon</a> and see for yourself, or give us a call at 630.572.0240 or send us an email and tell us about your business goals.</content:encoded>

			<title>System Center 2016 Technical Preview 2 Features</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-system-center/system-center-2016-preview</link>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft System Center 2016 is knocking on the door, and it’s chocked full of new features that are exciting all of us here as SWC. While only in Technical Preview 2 at the moment, we can expect System Center 2016 to be released early next year - and can already tell it's definitely worthy of migration. We are also excited to announce the expected release of system center Configuration Manager (SCCM) 2016 within the next few months, decoupled from the rest of the suite.
	<h2>New Features in Microsoft System Center 2016</h2>
	In announcing Technical Preview 2, Microsoft noted some of its favorite new System Center 2016. It now supports things like “mixed mode cluster upgrades” and it allows “enhanced scale-out file server management.” Microsoft also added the feature, “Desired State Configuration” support for managing Linux devices, which is a really cool PowerShell-enabled scheme for setting an optimal configuration state. Additionally, Microsoft System Center 2016 has improved monitoring of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP).
	
	Microsoft System Center 2016 Technical Preview 2 also complements Microsoft Operations Management Suite (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/operations-management-suite/Overview.aspx?WT.mc_id=Blog_SC_Announce_TTD" target="_blank">OMS</a>). Introduced during the Microsoft Ignite event, OMS is conceived as a standalone or complementary solution for organizations with hybrid environments to manage. Here's how a Microsoft spokesperson described OMS:
	
	<em>“OMS is a set of cloud-based services that customers can start using right away to simplify hybrid cloud management. Customers can either use OMS directly, or to complement their existing System Center management solutions with cross-cloud management capabilities, cloud-based log analytics, and additional core management capabilities such as protection, automation and security. As a cloud service, OMS offers customers rapid time to value without the complexity of deploying and integrating the various services.”</em>
	
	Furthermore, evaluators can use System Center 2016 Technical Preview 2 to test <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft/windows-10-features" target="_blank">Windows 10</a> in-place upgrades. The upgrades can be performed from Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 client versions.
	
	Technical Preview 2 can also be used to test mobile application management for devices running Android 4 and later, iOS 7, and older versions of iOS. One of my favorite features is the ability to restrict copy and paste operations between managed applications and personal applications via SCCM.
	
	Technical Preview 2 also works with Microsoft Intune to protect data accessed via mobile devices. This allows users to test a passcode reset capability as well as a remote lock control feature.

			<title>What’s the Best Way to Serve up Mobile Content?</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-marketing/types-of-mobile-websites</link>
			<pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 14:16:37 +0000</pubDate>
			<dc:creator><![CDATA[Jim Schmitz]]></dc:creator>
			<guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.swc.com/?p=17952</guid>
			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mobile content is a dish best served with your target audience in mind. With the way mobile trends are going, there is tremendous value in <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-marketing/fresh-content-seo" target="_blank">presenting your content</a> in a way that makes it easily consumable on a smartphone.
	
	If content is not easy to access via a mobile device, users will find another source for that content. Google has even adjusted their search algorithm so that <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-marketing/mobilegeddon-mobile-friendly-website" target="_blank">mobile-friendly sites receive a higher ranking</a> in searches made on a mobile device.
	
	But what is the best way to get your content in front of your target audience? Do you develop an app? Do you build a mobile version of your website? What about responsive design or a web app (is that even different than a “regular” app)?
	
	It’s essential to list the <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/application-development/mobile-device-web-application" target="_blank">pros and cons</a> of each of these solutions and help you find the one that will suit you best.
	
	As a designer and business analyst who has worked with all of these technologies, I’d like to start you on that path, but first, let’s define them.
	
	<img class="aligncenter wp-image-17957" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/OG-responsive.gif" alt="OG-responsive" width="500" height="263" />
	<h2>The App</h2>
	A mobile application, or app, is a program that is installed on a mobile device. Each operating system has a store where you can go to download apps for that device. Apps require you to agree to varying degrees of permissions before they can be installed.
	<h2>The Mobile Site</h2>
	Usually, a mobile site is built after there is already an existing non-mobile site. When a user enters a non-mobile URL on a mobile device, the system recognizes that and redirects them to the mobile site.
	
	Mobile sites can access various phone functionalities, but the user needs to actively give permission when they get to the site.
	<h2>The Responsive Site</h2>
	A website utilizing responsive design, also known as a responsive site, is a website that is designed to display differently depending on the device that is viewing it. Whether it is accessed on a desktop, tablet, or smart phone, the site knows the size of the screen and displays the page accordingly.
	<h2>The Web App</h2>
	A website application, almost always called a web app, is the least known of the options. It is a website accessed through a browser, but it is designed to look and function like an application. For all intents and purposes, it is just a mobile website. But where most websites are designed to serve information to a user, the web app is designed to be more “functional.”
	<h2>What Are Your Business Requirements?</h2>
	Let’s look at each of these pros/cons and examine some user tendencies to see how they might meet or fail to meet your business requirements.
	<h2>Online vs. Off-Line</h2>
	If your goal is for users to be able to access content while offline, an app is the way to go. Obviously, there are limitations: namely, the fact that all the content needs to be cached on the device.
	
	<h2>Accessibility</h2>
	
	A mobile site, a responsive site, and a web app can usually be used from any type of mobile device, whereas an app must have a different version created for each platform. And while it is true that there are technologies that let you build the app once and then “compile” it into different versions for each mobile operating system, these tools have limitations and will almost always produce less efficient code than if they were developed for one specific platform at a time.
	<h2>Ease of Access</h2>
	It is often easier to click on an app than it is to open your web browser and find a website. But users can be reluctant to download an app for something they do not think they will do very often, and there is an adoption curve with an app.
	<h2>Trust</h2>
	Research shows that a user is more likely to trust an app with personal information than they would trust a mobile website with the same information. There are a lot of complex sociological reasons for this, but the net result is that users are more willing to enter their credit card number in the Amazon app than on the Amazon mobile website.
	<h2>Development</h2>
	Development considerations take two forms: expertise and cost.
	
	Each of the options requires a (slightly) different skillset to create. Even if you are paying someone to create the app/site, you need to consider maintenance. You either need someone on staff who can make the updates, or you will be paying someone every time you want changes.
	
	If you build a mobile site, every time you make an update to the desktop site, you (generally) have to make it in on the mobile site as well. If you employ responsive design; however, you only have to make the change once. Depending on how the solution is created, and app may or may not need to be developed separately for each device type.
	<h2>Publishing</h2>
	Publishing information to a website is relatively easy. Apps are a different story. It takes approval time and can cost a fee for an app to be published to an app store.
	<h2>The Verdict</h2>
	In order to arrive at the right solution, you <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/ask-swc/custom-application-development-what-sets-swc-apart" target="_blank">need the right developer</a>. That’s where SWC comes in. We take a pragmatic approach to understanding your business needs in crafting a roadmap that solves your biggest challenges.

			<title>Office 365, Azure AD and Windows 10: Domain Controller Optional</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/azure-active-directory-and-windows-10</link>
			<pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2015 15:32:37 +0000</pubDate>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[When Azure Active Directory (AD) was first released, many companies asked, “Can this replace my on-premises Domain Controllers?” For Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1, the answer is “no” because Azure AD cannot connect to the computers. However, with the recent release of <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft/windows-10-features" target="_blank">Windows 10</a>, the answer to this question gets a lot more interesting. Read on to see what I mean.
	<h2>Windows 10 and Azure AD Join</h2>
	<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2015/05/13/azure-active-directory-and-windows-10-making-the-enterprise-cloud-a-reality.aspx" target="_blank">Azure AD Join is a new feature in Windows 10</a> that allows a computer to associate directly with your Office 365 Azure AD tenant. Setup is simple: First, a user is prompted whether they want to connect to an organization account (Office 365) or whether they want to join a domain. If they choose to associate with an organization account, all it takes is the Office 365 user name and password and the computer will automatically connect and associate with Azure AD. Once the join is complete, single sign-on (SSO) is handled by the computer just as it would with a domain joined machine. Also, any online services or policies that are applied to the user can be easily managed centrally via <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/extending-domain-microsoft-azure" target="_blank">Azure AD</a>. These policies might include Intune or other device management services. This allows for automatic deployment of management tools as part of the joining process.
	
	[caption id="attachment_17962" align="aligncenter" width="500"]<img class="wp-image-17962" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Azure-Active-Directory-OG.jpg" alt="Image courtesy Microsoft" width="500" height="363" /> Image courtesy Microsoft[/caption]
	<h2>Can I Join a Domain and Azure AD?</h2>
	Unfortunately, with the initial release of Windows 10, each user can only connect to one or the other. If a user is looking to join to a domain, they can later associate <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/cloud/active-directory-synchronization-vs-federation" target="_blank">their Office 365 account with their domain</a> account, but it won’t be a true Azure AD Join. Similarly, if a user performs an Azure AD Join, then they won’t be able to later use that same account with a domain.
	<h2>So Which Should I Use?</h2>
	Both are very useful and whichever option you choose often depends on the type of user. For a remote machine that will rarely, if ever, communicate with the on-premises domain, using Azure AD Join may be the way to go because it provides many of the same management and monitoring benefits without requiring local access.
	
	Similarly, for smaller organizations or organizations with many remote offices that don’t have domain controllers, Azure AD Join is very beneficial. As an added bonus, since Azure AD Join can work off of synchronized users to your existing domain, you can still have the same accounts and passwords in both systems.
	
	For the standard office environment with users local to the servers, or networking in place to allow for easy domain controller communication, using Active Directory is likely still your best option. You will continue to have the same domain experience everyone has come to expect, while at the same time the SSO options with Azure and Office 365 via Azure AD Connect and ADFS will continue to be available. As of now, Active Directory also still provides the larger feature set for the management and monitoring of systems via <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/microsoft-system-center/system-center-2016-preview" target="_blank">SCCM </a>and group policies, and so is recommended for environments that require that higher level of control.
	<h2>Flexibility to Manage Different User Sets</h2>
	Whichever you choose, keep in mind that you can always mix and match. For instance, if you have a central office but also have some remote users, you can use a combination of both the traditional Active Directory and Azure AD Join to provide the best experience to each user set. With Azure AD Join, Active Directory and Windows 10 you now have a lot more management flexibility than ever before.
	
	Would you like more information on Windows 10 and your domain options? Give our infrastructure experts a call at 630.572.0240 or <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">send us an email</a> and we’ll help you determine which domain option(s) are right for you.

			<title>Microsoft’s Acquisitions Creating a CRM Renaissance</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/customer-relationship-management/microsoft-dynamics-new-acquisition</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Are we seeing a renaissance at Microsoft when it comes to using <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/crm" target="_blank">Microsoft's Dynamics CRM</a> to service customers pre and post-sale? Two recent acquisitions by Microsoft confirm that the recent realignment of their Dynamics CRM to the Cloud and Enterprise (C+E) team was a strategic doubling down on the CRM market.
	<h2>Microsoft Acquires Global Provider of Field Service Management Systems</h2>
	The recent announcement of <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2015/07/16/microsoft-acquires-fieldone-global-provider-of-field-service-management-solutions-for-the-enterprise/" target="_blank">Microsoft’s acquisition of FieldOne</a> gives Dynamics CRM more depth of functionality for their customer service module. FieldOne is already in the cloud which aligns well with their <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2014/01/07/microsoft-acquires-parature-to-add-leading-customer-self-service-suite-to-microsoft-dynamics-crm/" target="_blank">Parature acquisition</a>, new <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/customer-relationship-management/data-migration" target="_blank">Microsoft Dynamics Marketing </a>(MDM), and core CRM Online services.
	
	It will be interesting to see what this means for customers who use on-premises CRM. Right now, the experience with on-premises customers who use Parature or MDM is a bit disjointed; it feels like you are using software from two vendors. This will inevitably get better over time—something we are familiar with across many Microsoft-acquired and integrated products.
	<h2>Microsoft Acquires FantasySalesTeam’s Gamification Platform</h2>
	More recently, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2015/08/03/microsoft-acquires-fantasysalesteam-an-innovative-sales-gamification-platform-to-help-organizations-increase-productivity/" target="_blank">acquisition of FantasySalesTeam</a>, a sales gamification platform tied to CRM that helps boost sales productivity through team-based competition.
	
	Gamification is being used more and more in sales/contact centers. Basically, it's designed to make the sales process more rewarding by motivating employees to accomplish goals and hit stated metrics.
	
	In contact centers, the quicker the customer service representative can resolve an issue, the more tickets they can get to in a day. What's interesting about this acquisition is that FantasySalesTeam is taking on gamification for sales teams. For those of us in sales, we know that many times motivating sales professionals is a little bit like herding cats. This acquisition has some "cool" factor built in because they are tying a sports fan concept into a business process. We can't wait to see how this turns out.
	<h2>The New and Improved Microsoft Dynamics</h2>
	Microsoft is doubling down on improving worker productivity within their already feature-rich and competitively-priced Dynamics CRM suite of products. Recent acquisitions only add to its value. If you would like to learn more about how your organization can take advantage of <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/customer-relationship-management/crm-maturity-model" target="_blank">managing your customer lifecycle</a>—from marketing to sales to service—give us a call at 630.572.0240 or <a href="mailto:info@swc.com">email us</a> email us about your business challenges.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Walter Hogan is a Senior Consultant on the application development side of SWC’s Software Solutions Group. Walter loves the variety of <a href="http://www.swc.com/coolstuff" target="_blank">cool projects</a> he gets to work on at SWC and also being part of a dynamic team where he is constantly motivated, challenged and able to learn and grow his skills.
	
	We sat down with Walter to give potential applicants a glimpse of what it’s like to be an Application Software Developer at SWC.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>You’ve been working at SWC for a while now. What makes SWC a great place to work?</strong></h4>
	<h4></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png"><img class="  wp-image-18045 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png" alt="Walter-Hogan" width="120" height="120" /></a>My answer is the same for “What makes SWC a great place to work?” and “What’s the most challenging thing about working at SWC?” It’s the variety. Everything we do here is very fast-paced. Typically, internal IT works at a much slower pace because you have specific projects that you’re working towards, but we work on many diverse projects simultaneously.
	
	It’s fun and it’s challenging because there is constant change. I think being challenged every day is a pillar of any great IT position, and that challenge keeps you happy, motivated, and it whets your appetite to learn and grow your skills.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>What technologies do you utilize in your role?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18045 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png" alt="Walter-Hogan" width="120" height="120" /></a>I work with .NET and SQL and I split my time between application development and business intelligence (BI).
	
	With the Application Software Developer role, we like to see someone with a diverse technology background come in the door—someone with experience in technologies such as .NET, SQL, C#, Java, SharePoint, CRM, and BI.
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>What qualities make a successful Application Software Developer?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18045 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png" alt="Walter-Hogan" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	
	We try to understand a candidate’s personal career goals; do they see themselves starting to manage projects, or are they more of the technical type where they want to architect a solution but not necessarily be client-facing? If they do have an interest in being client-facing, we’d like to see related experience and understand different scenarios and challenges in communicating with clients.
	
	<strong><a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a></strong>
	<h4><strong>What are some day-to-day challenges that an Application Software Developer will face?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18045 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png" alt="Walter-Hogan" width="120" height="120" /></a>It’s one of the reasons I love my job, but managing time is one of the more difficult aspects of software development. I think that never really goes away because things are constantly changing. But if you stay organized and know how to prioritize, you can succeed. One thing I tell people coming in is that consulting is a lot different than an internal IT position. We have to be accountable for our time. That was probably the hardest thing I faced my first year here: having to figure out what I did for 8 hours and then log it. But that comes with time and experience; you learn to manage your time better.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>What was one of the most memorable projects you’ve worked on?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18045 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png" alt="Walter-Hogan" width="120" height="120" /></a>I have been fortunate enough to work on some of the biggest projects that our Software Solutions Group has ever undertaken. One in particular involved the processing of a huge volume of transactions—millions of records per day—and the application we were building needed to take into account a number of performance considerations. We couldn’t just use the first approach we came up with; we had to run different scenarios.
	
	It was difficult because the client wanted results on a tight deadline, but having that sense of accomplishment upon successful delivery to a happy client made it all worthwhile. It definitely was a growing experience. We took a lot of skills away from that.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>How is the work-life balance at SWC?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18045 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png" alt="Walter-Hogan" width="120" height="120" /></a>SWC has always made work-life balance a priority on many levels. Whether we are having a team meeting or a one-on-one meeting, work-life balance is often woven into the conversation. Occasionally it happens where there is a pressing issue and they ask for volunteers for a project, but I can think of only one time ever where it needed to be me. That’s something I appreciate because overtime has been expected at my prior jobs. People are more willing to put in the time when it’s not mandated.
	
	<strong><a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a></strong>
	<h4><strong>What professional development opportunities are there?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18045 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Walter-Hogan.png" alt="Walter-Hogan" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	
	Typically, people who are in our field have a desire to keep learning, and SWC promotes that for us in Software because we have career advocates assigned to everyone. We meet with our career advocates every two weeks and they help coach us with our careers, give us advice and advocate for our professional development. Every time I’ve ever wanted to do something new, that’s the first place I go. I’ve learned new skills and technologies because I’ve asked my career advocate, “How do I get involved in the next project doing [this]?” SWC has a great career development program.
	
	The incentive system here encourages learning and skillset growth as well. You get incentives based on the level of certification you complete. The incentives are also based on company need. You’ll get incentives for certifications no matter what, but if you receive a certification that the company needs, they may offer a higher rate so that more people will be motivated to take the tests.
	
	<strong><a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a></strong>
	<h4><strong>What are some of your favorite SWC perks and experiences?</strong></h4>

	The holiday party, summer outing, weekly beer o’clock, constant company lunches…it’s a long (and growing) <a href="http://www.swc.com/careers/swc-benefits" target="_blank">list of career perks</a>!

			<title>Keyword Research for Modern Search Engine Optimization</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/digital-marketing/keyword-research</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you’ve ever wondered, “Why am I not showing up in Google for my primary keywords?” You’re not alone. Everyone wants better search ranking and they’re looking to Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for answers.
	
	The trouble is, SEO keeps changing! In the beginning, there were keywords… lots of them, all over the page. This made it easy for almost anyone to start stuffing and ranking. Today, the method to increase ranking potential is much more complex. Even if a page does not include the exact keyword used in a search query, it may still rank higher than a page that does. Given this change in Google’s algorithm, it’s natural to wonder: Do keywords still matter?
	<h2>SEO Is Not Dead</h2>
	As long there are search engines and you want your business to be found in them, SEO will always exist. The methods may change, but the goal remains the same. As the complexities of Google’s ranking algorithm continue to evolve at great speed, appointing a <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/digital-marketing/search-engine-optimization" target="_blank">dedicated SEO expert</a> has become a necessity for many organizations. Even <a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/opinion/google-is-hiring-an-seo-expert-to-do-better-in-google-rankings-716106" target="_blank">Google is seeking an SEO expert</a> to increase rankings for its own products pages!
	
	If you’re looking for help researching, evaluating and placing keywords on your website for better optimization, there are some steps you should consider beyond just researching keyword volume and competition.
	<h2>What to Consider When Doing Keyword Research</h2>
	<h4>Target Audience</h4>
	Keyword research no longer begins with a keyword. It begins with the user. Google says it themselves:
	<blockquote>People communicate with each other by conversation, not by typing keywords – and we’ve been hard at work to make Google understand and answer your questions more like people do.</blockquote>
	- Amit Singhal, Senior Vice President of Google
	
	Before you even begin plugging keywords into research tools such as Google AdWords Keyword Planner, define the demographics of your audience, such as age, gender and geographical location. More importantly, understand what they need, their pain points, and how you’re specific products or services can give them what they want. This means searching for the most relevant keyword phrases and using them naturally in your content instead of employing the same strict keyword over and over again. By beginning your keyword research with the user, you’re not only writing content your target audience will love, you’re writing content the search engines will love as well.
	<h4>TF*IDF</h4>
	There are more than 6 billion searches conducted in Google per day. Over the years, that adds up to a massive amount of information Google can use to understand how certain phrases tend to predict other phrases. This allows Google to move beyond its dependency on keyword frequency alone and utilize more complex algorithms in the form of Term-Frequency Inverses-Document Frequency (TF*IDF).
	
	Term frequency (TF) is how many times a term is used on a page proportional to the length of the page. This helps identify keyword stuffing. Inversion Document Frequency (IDF) measures the importance of a specific term for relevancy based on the entire web. Keeping this measurement in mind, you’ll want to avoid keyword stuffing while also examining synonyms and language that is semantically related to your primary keyword in order to provide better contextual signals to search engines.
	<h4>Keyword Placement</h4>
	Every website is made up of different parts: header, body content, images, sidebars, footers and more. Search engines give higher priority to the content that populates certain areas of a webpage. For example, if you are optimizing for your Pet Store business, placing the keyword phrase “Chicago Pet Store” once in the HTML tag, once in the header and once in the body content is more effective than stuffing it 10 times in a single paragraph.
	
	Google uses signals in the HTML of your website to identify where the prominent areas of your page are located. Header tags, HTML titles and schema tags are ways to help the search engines understand the context of your page. Whether you’re building a website from scratch or looking for ways to enhance your website for SEO, it’s important that the development team is working side-by-side an SEO specialist to ensure search engines are able to find and index the most important pieces of content.
	<h2>Want to Learn More About SEO and Digital Marketing Strategies?</h2>
	Utilizing these keyword research techniques to identify and implement keywords will give your website some powerful contextual signals. However, this is just the first step in search engine optimization. There are many other factors that also contribute to the ranking potential of your website.
	
	For more information on search engine optimization, web design and digital marketing strategies, attend one of our <a href="http://www.swc.com/events" target="_blank">Chicagoland SEO and Internet Marketing events</a>. This complimentary event is a great opportunity to begin the conversation around keywords and SEO, and see what actually works from today’s market leaders.

			<title>Make Phone Calls from Office 365 with Skype for Business Online</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/unified-communications/phone-calls-from-office-365-with-skype-for-business</link>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[You’ll soon be able to make phone calls from Office 365 with <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/unified-communications/skype-business">Skype for Business</a> Online. We’re getting tons of questions from <a href="http://www.swc.com/swc-technology-partners/news/10-things-every-skype-for-business-administrator-should-know">Skype for Business Administrators</a> at SWC and I’d like to take a moment to address a few of them.
	<h2>What does this mean for making phone calls with Skype for Business?</h2>
	Very simply, right now Office 365 tenants selected for the preview can assign phone numbers to their users and make inbound and outbound calls from their Skype for Business clients. They can also host conferences with PSTN connectivity—all within Microsoft’s cloud.
	
	<img class="alignnone wp-image-18141" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Skype-For-Business-Image.jpg" alt="Skype-For-Business-Image" width="500" height="267" />
	<h2>Can it replace my PBX?</h2>
	That’s exactly the intention, but not today, and maybe not this year. The first wave of the enhancements will allow for basic inbound and outbound calling, conferencing, and voicemail. Full feature parity including response/hunt groups, common area phones, E911, and more serious reporting won’t be available until a later date. <strong>If you’re running in a small office with very simple requirements, you might be a good candidate for the first wave.</strong>
	<h2>Is it a good idea to put my PBX in the cloud?</h2>
	Someday it will be strange to have telephony on premises, but it’s going to be a slow transition. Regardless of the location of the phone system, there are still many factors to consider and your network quality is key. If you don’t need much and can tolerate a few poor quality calls, outsourcing may be a no-brainer. If you have complex requirements including reporting, call centers, multiple E911 locations, and need to guarantee quality voice calls, a comprehensive deployment plan and careful planning are critical to success. It’s also important to keep in mind that you also have the option to outsource a portion of the system while keeping the most critical components in your infrastructure.
	<h2>What do you think of it so far?</h2>
	To be honest, it’s fantastic. <strong>I haven’t had any serious issues and call quality has far exceeded my expectations.</strong> We at SWC are very excited to see this take shape.
	<h2>When will the ability to make phone calls from Office 365 be available?</h2>
	The basics will be available before the end of this year. More advanced features will roll out in 2016.
	<h2>I want to replace my PBX now, should I wait?</h2>
	Not necessarily. If you have a phone system that needs to be replaced, all of the features are available right now in Skype for Business which can run in your own datacenter. It can be configured in a hybrid approach so that when the cloud is ready, you will be too.
	
	Make your workplace a more communicative and productive one with Skype for Business. Join me for SWC’s complimentary <a href="http://www.swc.com/skype-for-business-event">Skype for Business Luncheon</a> to learn more about Skype for Business Online, or contact one of our <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/unified-communications">unified communications experts</a> and we’ll put our Microsoft Unified Communications Gold Partner status to work for you.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Brad Ellison is an Engagement Manager at SWC Technology Partners. This client facing role allows him to utilize his sales and interpersonal communication skills to build long-term relationships with SWC’s customers. His extensive background and former role at SWC as a Senior Network Engineer has allowed him to become the leader of SWC’s <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-system-center/service-manager">Microsoft System Center practice</a>.
	
	We sat down with Brad to give those seeking a <a href="http://www.swc.com/careers">career in business and technology</a> a glimpse of what it’s like to be an <a href="http://www.swc.com/careers/chicago-business-engagement-manager-job">Engagement Manager</a> at SWC.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>HOW DID YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A NETWORK ENGINEER PREPARE YOU FOR THE ROLE AS AN ENGAGEMENT MANAGER?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18155 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png" alt="brad-ellison" width="120" height="120" /></a>My background as a Senior Network Engineer has allowed me to take the conversation deeper than most “sales guys”. I can talk about the actual solution design to clients’ IT departments and can speak with business leaders on the productivity and efficiency gains SWC’s solutions provide their businesses. I know how our proposed solutions plays with existing technologies and systems which allows me to build value for my customers in that I’m able to take an idea and help mold it into an exact solution.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>WHAT QUALITIES MAKE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT MANAGER?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18155 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png" alt="brad-ellison" width="120" height="120" /></a>First and foremost, a successful EM has a true and deep passion for helping the customer succeed. This means providing exact solutions to specific business challenges. When that happens, everyone in the process is successful and the partnership strengthens.
	
	A successful EM is personable and has strong leadership and organizational skills. Public speaking and the ability to command meetings is also a must.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>WHAT’S YOUR FAVORITE PART OF YOUR JOB AT SWC TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18155 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png" alt="brad-ellison" width="120" height="120" /></a>My favorite part is seeing a project come together and having that feeling of accomplishment when the client is completely satisfied and starts to see efficiency gains from the newly implemented solution. I also love being able to meet new people and present at our <a href="http://www.swc.com/events">complimentary technology luncheons</a>.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>HOW HAS SWC ENABLED YOUR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL CAREER?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18155 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png" alt="brad-ellison" width="120" height="120" /></a>There are a lot of people here that I consider true friends. Not only are they fun to go out with, but I’m always learning from them. Professionally, if you are willing to work hard at SWC, the opportunities are endless. One thing leadership does very well is work to create those opportunities that allow the team to mature and grow. They reward you for your willingness to learn and grow your skills.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE SWC CAREER PERKS AND EXPERIENCES?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18155 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png" alt="brad-ellison" width="120" height="120" /></a>I love the golf outings, the abundance of free food, and the events that our Wellness Committee organizes. SWC looks out for our health while at the same time tempting us with great <a href="http://www.swc.com/careers/swc-benefits">perks </a>and tasty treats.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>WHAT WAS THE MOST CHALLENGING AND/OR REWARDING SYSTEM CENTER PROJECT YOU HAVE BEEN A PART OF?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18155 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png" alt="brad-ellison" width="120" height="120" /></a>The most rewarding System Center project I’ve been part of was when we helped a customer go from a situation where they were spending an immense amount of time manually deploying PCs, reacting to infrastructure and applications challenges and haphazardly managing help desk incidents. There was a lack of both a formal process and the tools necessary to automate these tasks.
	
	By helping them deploy <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-system-center/configuration-manager-sccm">SCCM</a>, <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-system-center/operations-manager-scom">SCOM</a>, <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-system-center/service-manager">SCSM </a>and Orchestrator, and providing the necessary information, training and tools to allow them to be successful; our customer been able to provide better support to the business and free up their lean and mean IT staff to focus on more value-added initiatives. It was a huge success for our customer which will allow them to reap the benefits of this solution for a long time to come.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18068 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/fran-peters-circle.png" alt="fran-peters-circle" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>ARE WE EVER GOING TO SEE ANOTHER BEERS WITH BRAD? THE PEOPLE ARE THIRSTY FOR A NEW EPISODE.</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18155 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/brad-ellison.png" alt="brad-ellison" width="120" height="120" /></a>It certainly has been a while since we’ve done a <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/events/beers-with-brad-cio-tech-talk">Beers with Brad</a> episode and it brings back fond memories when customers recognize me out of the blue from past shows. I absolutely look forward to doing more episodes focused on diving in to today’s most pressing and top of mind IT and business topics (such as security), while maintaining a light atmosphere full of beer, banter and Brad. Stay tuned!

			<title>Power BI and IoT:  A Game Changer for Real-time Analytics</title>
			<link>http://www.swc.com/blog/business-intelligence/power-bi-and-iot-for-real-time-analytics</link>
			<pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2015 15:58:37 +0000</pubDate>

			<description></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since last spring, <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/microsoft-office-365/power-bi">Power BI</a> has had the capability to accept live stream data from the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/stream-analytics/">Azure Stream Analytics</a> service. We, SWC, started to tinker with the offering during the summer and built our first streaming dashboard with a Twitter sentiment feed. It was a lot of fun and surprisingly easy to build. With our feet wet and our appetites whet, we decided to build something a bit more practical.
	<h2>Enter the Internet of Plants</h2>
	Yes, you read that right; we’re building a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things" target="_blank">IoT</a> demo environment of networked potted plants.
	
	<a title="Internet Of Plants - A Power BI and Microsoft Azure Demo " href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mq3g6AO9ZUM?rel=0" rel="shadowbox; player=iframe; width=720; height=480"><img src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Internet-of-plants.jpg" alt="New Features of Tableau 8.2" width="474" height="262" /></a>
	
	Using <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi 2</a> , <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48232" target="_blank">Windows 10 Core Edition</a> and various commodity sensors and Wi-Fi adapters, we will be collecting plant health data such as moisture/humidity, temperature, and light. That information will be sent to Azure for processing and then outputted to Power BI for analysis. All in all, the cost for each device fully configured has been under $80.
	
	<img class="alignnone wp-image-18160" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/internet-of-plants.png" alt="internet-of-plants" width="650" height="396" />
	<img class="alignnone wp-image-18161" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/internet-of-things-2.png" alt="internet-of-things-2" width="650" height="266" />
	<h2>What Does this Mean for My Business?</h2>
	The internet of plants demo is fun and does a good job of demonstrating the capability of the Microsoft BI platform for your business. Many organizations, particularly in manufacturing, collect massive amounts of sensor data from many devices. Until now, the analysis of that sensor data was often done via proprietary solutions or isn’t analyzed in a timely fashion due to the technical challenges of getting the data in format that business users can understand. Azure and Power BI greatly simplify the architecture and allow for easier and cheaper real-time analytics.
	
	Over the next few months the SWC Business Intelligence team will be showcasing our IoT solutions at <a href="http://www.swc.com/events">luncheons </a>and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Business-Intelligence-Chicagoland/">meetups</a>, and we welcome you to come and take a look for yourselves. These events are a great opportunity to network, ask questions and build out your corporate IoT and analytics strategy. We look forward to sharing our expertise!
	
	If you would like more information about IoT or what business intelligence can do you for your organization, <a href="http://www.swc.com/contact">contact SWC</a> or call 630.572.0240 to speak with one of our BI experts.
	<h2>Map the Road to Business Success with Microsoft &amp; SWC</h2>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Does this exchanges between employees in finance departments and the CEO of the company sound familiar?
	
	<em>“What’s with that email you sent?”
	“What email?”
	“The one where you told me to wire money to that bank in China.”
	“I never sent such an email.”</em>
	
	CEO fraud usually starts with thieves either <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/security/email-phishing">phishing </a>an executive and gaining access to that individual’s email, or emailing employees from look-alike domains. For example, if the domain name for the organization is abc.com, the thieves might send emails from abc.co. To date the FBI has calculated <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/fbi-1-2b-lost-to-business-email-scams/">the loss from CEO fraud to be at $1.2 billion</a>.
	
	<img class="alignnone wp-image-18167" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/phishing.png" alt="phishing" width="650" height="341" />
	
	These types of emails often don’t get caught or quarantined and are targeted to specific people in the organization. The thieves usually do their homework and scour the web for any information about a company (LinkedIn). Once they’ve built up a good knowledge base, they go after those they know will likely fall prey to the “CEO’s” demands to wire money.
	
	These thieves have gone to school and done their homework. Now, organizations and their employees must do the same. <strong>Security awareness training</strong> is paramount in today’s world. Employees need to know how to recognize simple yet key indicators in phishing emails. Key indicators include looking at the “from” address, the body of the email (English is usually not the attackers first language), and perhaps the easiest indicator, the origin of the bank where the money needs to be wired to. If your organization has never conducted operations in countries such as China or Russia, why would a CEO request such a transfer? <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/security/lastpass-hack-prevention" target="_blank">Two-factor or multi-factor authentication</a> should be a must for transferring large sums of money.
	
	The “CEO Fraud” example above is just one of many ways attackers go after employees via email. Attackers can also embed links in emails with malicious executables, and all it takes is one person to click that link and the network could be compromised.
	
	SWC offers comprehensive <a href="http://www.swc.com/solutions/security-services/security-managed-services" target="_blank">security awareness training</a> to educate end users on how to detect these malicious scenarios. We also offer phishing campaigns simulated from an attacker’s perspective to gain an understanding of whether or not your users are clicking on these emails, as well as implementing right-sized technologies to assist a company’s overall security.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[Zeba Hasan is on the Network Operations Center (NOC) team in SWC’s Managed Services practice. Zeba enjoys working at SWC because we have a great corporate culture and team dynamic, she also enjoys all of the professional development opportunities SWC provides her to grow in her career.
	
	We sat down with Zeba to give potential applicants a glimpse of what it’s like to be an <a href="http://www.swc.com/careers/chicago-information-technology-associate-engineer-job">Associate Engineer</a> at SWC.
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jill-photo.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18177 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jill-photo.png" alt="jill-photo" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	<h4><strong>What makes SWC a great place to work?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Zeba-careers.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18178 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Zeba-careers.png" alt="Zeba-careers" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	
	What makes SWC <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/careers/crains-best-places-to-work-2015" target="_blank">a great place to work</a> is a combination of things, namely the culture, people, and the team environment. It’s very well-rounded and professional, but at the same time we have a lot of fun here with company activities and celebrations. SWC really likes to celebrate our achievements!
	
	<strong><a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jill-photo.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18177 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jill-photo.png" alt="jill-photo" width="120" height="120" /></a></strong>
	<h4><strong>What skills and qualities make a successful Associate Engineer? </strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Zeba-careers.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18178 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Zeba-careers.png" alt="Zeba-careers" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	
	Since we do consulting for a multitude of clients, it’s really helpful for anyone applying for the Associate Engineer position to have been in consulting or worked with many different clients at the same time.
	
	As far as skills, you need to have a little bit of everything when you’re coming into consulting—not just technical skills, but organizational and writing as well.
	
	Personality-wise, we look for someone who is eager to learn. There is a lot to learn here, but it’s never too overwhelming because we have such a great team; everyone wants to help you. And because there is a lot to learn, you are always growing your skills, which in IT is absolutely essential.
	
	<strong><a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jill-photo.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18177 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jill-photo.png" alt="jill-photo" width="120" height="120" /></a></strong>
	<h4><strong>How is the work-life balance at SWC?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Zeba-careers.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18178 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Zeba-careers.png" alt="Zeba-careers" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/careers/chicago-it-solutions-provider-work-life-balance" target="_blank">Work/life is really well balanced</a>, especially for an IT consulting firm. Employees say that SWC is fundamentally different from their previous places of employment, and I would have to completely agree based on my past positions.
	
	In many IT jobs, you are expected to work overtime and always be on the grid. At SWC, there are times you will also have to work overtime, but we take turns doing it. On our particular team, we have pager duty or are “on call” once every six weeks – which is not bad at all! We have one person “on pager” from the NOC, service desk, and escalations team in case of an emergency, or if our afterhours team gets overwhelmed. They can then call us for help.
	
	<strong><a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jill-photo.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18177 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jill-photo.png" alt="jill-photo" width="120" height="120" /></a></strong>
	<h4><strong>What professional development opportunities are there?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Zeba-careers.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18178 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Zeba-careers.png" alt="Zeba-careers" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	
	The great thing about SWC is that they will help put you on the <a href="http://www.swc.com/blog/ask-swc/what-are-your-favorite-career-development-initiatives" target="_blank">career path</a> you want to go down. We have regular meetings with our career advocates to make sure we are on the right track to grow our skills and pursue our areas of interest. If you are good at what you do and exceed expectations then you will find that there are many different paths you can take.
	
	SWC also covers the cost of certifications. If it’s in line with your career goals, they will make sure you are working towards at least one certification.
	
	<strong><a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jill-photo.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18177 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/jill-photo.png" alt="jill-photo" width="120" height="120" /></a></strong>
	<h4><strong>What are some of your favorite SWC perks and experiences?</strong></h4>
	&nbsp;
	
	<a href="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Zeba-careers.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-18178 alignleft" src="http://www.swc.com/uploads/Zeba-careers.png" alt="Zeba-careers" width="120" height="120" /></a>
	
	SWC does a lot for their employees and I appreciate that. There is always free food and drinks. They are always looking for new, creative ways to celebrate our achievements, so there are lots of events and parties. They even treated us to a manicure/pedicure one time!
